            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe former Undertaking of this Reverend and learned Author, hath found ſo much acceptance, and hath been received with ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Approbation, both by Miniſters and other godly Chriſtians, as that it hath emboldened him to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eſſay in the ſame kinde. This enſuing Treatiſe preſents to thy view a brief Explication of, and choice Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon three other of the Leſſer Prophets. All that I ſhall ſay to encourage thee to reade it, is, That it is written by the ſame <hi>Maſter Hutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that it is as elaborate and as uſeful as the former, that it will fully ſatisfie expectation, and tend much to thy ſpiritual edification.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch is the tender kindneſſe and rich bounty of our all ſufficient and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God to his Church and people, whom he hath choſen from among the loſt poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> as that in wrath he ſtill remembreth mercy; and when his diſpenſations ſeem to ſpeak greateſt diſpleaſure, and to render them moſt miſerable: yet upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration they will finde cauſe to ſay, that <hi>he is good, and his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> He doth
<pb facs="tcp:169977:4"/>not deny to them the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> when for wiſe reaſons he cuts ſhort their outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and their afflictions when they need them, are taken in as Articles and Priviledges of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Covenant with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
            <p>In particular, it is a mercy never enough acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Lord vouchſafes upon his people his Word written in holy Scriptures, which as it was a ſpecial favour to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. ſo the riches thereof, and the advantages to be had thereby are not ſoon pondered; for herein is held forth the true and ſaving knowledge of God, and an impartial diſcovery of our ſelves; herein we have the offer of the ſalvation purchaſed by Chriſt, and by it is the infallible way of attaining true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe pointed out. It is to the Word we are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the righteouſneſſe of faith, to know the minde of God concerning loſt ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. It is the Word the Lord employes to be the ſeed of regeneration, and which the regenerate man ſhould eſteem more then his neceſſary food, for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his growth: By the Word the Lord doth quicken his people when they are dead, reclaime them when they are wandring, comfort them when they are afflicted, and point out their way unto them. Hereby we are directed to try the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when deluſions are aloft, and Satan is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angel of light. By the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we may infallibly know what is right, and what is wrong in the world, when all things are to ſenſe wrapped up in clouds and miſts, and may know what to think of ſad times and lots, and what iſſue
<pb facs="tcp:169977:4"/>to expect of them. And in a word, the Scriptures are <hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.</p>
            <p>As this great and ineſtimable favour ought to engage all Chriſtians to be much in ſearching the Scriptures, and converſant with God ſpeaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (eſpecially in times when the Lord's letting out many ſtrong deluſions, proclaims our negligence, and not receiving the love of the truth; and when his chaſtiſements call on us to ſeek teaching out of his Law.) And as it doth call on Miniſters in their publick ſtations, to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, inculcating this Word of truth: ſo it hath invited me to eſſay how I might be inſtrumental, through the Lords aſſiſtance and bleſſing, in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſome parts of this Charter, for the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe and help of the Lords people: And having met with ſuch acceptance of my former Eſſay, as hath encouraged me to make this further progreſſe, upon theſe three laſt of the Leſſer Prophets; I do humbly crave leave to preſent it to the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Lordſhips Honourable name, who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy of the Lord, to taſte that he is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as is daily evidenced by your deſiring the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the Word, and by your cordial reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſincere endeavour to cleave to the Law and Teſtimony, and follow the revealed Will of God in your wayes. Which as it hath made your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip precious in the hearts of the godly who know you; ſo I judge my ſelf bound in a ſpecial way, to take hold of this opportunity to expreſſe my ſenſe
<pb facs="tcp:169977:5"/>of the ſame, who have had more frequent ocea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for many yeares, (both during my ſervice in the Miniſtery in that part of the countrey, where your Lordſhips intereſt and reſidence is, and ſince my removal from thence) to be a witneſſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the grace of God in you, and have met with ſuch undeſerved reſpects, for the truthes cauſe, from your Lordſhip, as requires a more worthy te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and acknowledgement of my obligations, and bound dutie to honour you, then is this piece, as to what is my part in it. Yet ſuch as it is, I make bold to offer it to your Lordſhip, and being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of holy Scriptures, and of ſuch places, as do hold forth much of the Lords minde, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his publick work, and ſtate of his Church; I hope it ſhall not be unacceptable to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whoſe care and diligence in ſeeking light from God, and cleaving to it, and whoſe following the publick work of God in ſingleneſſe of heart, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the prejudice of your particular intereſt) hath convinced and put to ſilence, even ſuch as were enemies thereunto.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt on this ſubject, which I know your Lordſhip takes no pleaſure to hear of, nor is it my way to dwell much upon; nor ſhall I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Lordſhip with any account concerning my part in this work; only this I may ſay, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter is divine; being a part of that light which ſhined in a dark place in the dayes of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; many paſſages thereof need an Interpreter and threed of Expoſition as much as any, and the doctrine therein contained is uſeful for our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, on whom the ends of the world are come.
<pb facs="tcp:169977:5"/>We may reade herein the true cauſes of <hi>Judahs</hi> captivity, the ill uſe they made of deliverance, which drew new plagues upon them out of Gods hand, and their conceit of external performances, when yet they neglected the weighty matters of the Law. We will finde God ſo reproving them for ſin, as yet encouraging them to duty, and richly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them when they are engaged in it; we will ſee them declining after a reformation, and this to be the cauſe of the many calamities that enſued. We will alſo finde here many ſweet Predictions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah, in the accompliſhment whereof, the Goſpel-Church ought to rejoyce, and predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the various diſpenſations of God toward his ancient people the Jewes; partly, in their rejection and diſperſion after the coming of the Meſſiah, in the accompliſhment whereof, we ſhould reade the ſeverity of God; and partly, in their future converſion and recollection, which we ſhould be much in prayer to God for, that he would haſten it. Theſe and many other precious truths, are expreſſed in theſe Prophecies, and briefly hinted at in the Expoſition and Notes: Which that they may prove uſeful to the Church of God, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular to your Lordſhip, is the prayer of</p>

                  <p>IN this Chapter, (after the Inſcription, <hi>v.</hi> 1.) we have 1. A Sermon reproving the peoples ſinful negligence, and ſtirring them up to build the Temple: wherein he reproves their ſhifting to put hand to this work, as if the time of doing it were not come, whereas they were moſt active in their own private affaires, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3, 4.

                     </gap>tting what hath been obſerved on former Inſcriptions; <hi>We may learn hence,</hi> 1. Whatever men may think of Gods threatenings when they are in proſperity, and of his promiſes when they are in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yet time will prove the truth of both in experience; as here it is ſuppoſed, notwithſtanding this peoples preſumption while they ſtood a Kingdome, and their fainting in captivity, yet they had both been ſent into captivity, as the Prophets had ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them, and were brought back again according to Gods promiſe. 2. When the Lord hath delivered his people from the outward captivity wherein they were held, he may ſee it fit to keep them yet in a low and poore eſtate, that they may yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſins, which neither before nor in their captivity, have been ſeriouſly laid to heart, and may be kept from doating on much external glory, but be held eying that which is the true ſpiritual glory of the Church; for theſe ends are the Jewes when returned yet under <hi>Darius the King,</hi> their time reckoned by the yeares of his reigne, as a token of their ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and have only a <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of their own, in ſtead of the Kingly dignity they formerly enjoyed. 3. As the Lord in mercy toward his people, ſweeteneth their ſad times by ſending meſſengers unto them, as a meanes and token of good: ſo it is an encouragement to his ſervants to go on in their duty in moſt deſperate times, when they conſider that his bleſſing upon the endeavours of a preaching Miniſtery, may be effectual to help forward his work ſpeedily, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this had lien long behinde; for here <hi>the Word of the Lord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169977:10"/>came by Haggai</hi> to them, and that <hi>in the ſecond yeare of Darius.</hi> Now the work was finiſhed in his ſixth yeare, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.15. which being fourty ſix yeares in building, <hi>John</hi> 2.20. gives us to underſtand that by his and <hi>Zechariahs</hi> help, (as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led helpers, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.2.) the work went faſter on in ſome yeares, then in fourty two yeares before; yea, when it had been laid by ſo long before. 4. As it is the duty of faithful Watchmen, to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, ſo eſpecially to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of afflictions on ſinful people, to ſee how the rod may help the Word to work: therefore came the Word of the Lord <hi>in the ſixth moneth,</hi> that their ſcarce harveſt (as is marked, <hi>v.</hi> 6.) might excite them to conſider Gods Word. 5. It is the duty of men in higheſt power to ſubmit to what God ſaith in his Word, and to be active alſo that the Word of God have place amongſt others, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </q>
                  <p>That the Lord may reprove their negligence in building the Temple, he propounds their pretences whereby they thought to juſtifie them ſelves; to wit, that finding many lets and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and many difficulties from themſelves, they neither pretend to unwillingneſſe, nor yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe misbelief but that it will be built; only (however the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty yeares of their captivity were expired) they pretend that Gods time was not come, wherein they ſhould meet with no rubs, and might be able to build it more ſtately, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to acquieſce in Gods ſecret Will and Providence, looking for better times. This the Lord refutes from their own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, who did admit of no ſuch excuſe in their own affaires,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169977:10"/>but notwithſtanding all difficulties and vexations every one builded ſtately houſes to themſelves, and how much more might all of them build an houſe unto the Lord? <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a fearful, though uſual ſin in the Church, when that which is the principal fruit and end of all their deliverances, and a chief meanes of their happineſſe, and which they ſeemed to eſteem moſt of when they wanted it, is moſt neglected when they are delivered, and have occaſion to teſtifie their affection and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, ſuch was the building of the Temple to this people, and yet this <hi>houſe lies waſte.</hi> 2. It is a moſt dangerous way of ſinning, when the ſinner pretends affection to God when he wrongs him and his matters moſt, and when he thinks himſelf able by faire pretences to excuſe, if not to juſtifie his way; ſo did this people ſin, alledging no diſaffection, but that <hi>the time is not come, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As the Lord may permit very great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to be laid in the way of a work, which yet he will carry on: (as was ſeen in this Temple, which took fourty ſix yeares, ere it could be gotten perfect:) ſo a people, who do not openly diſaffect the work, may ſinfully concur in obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as the Jewes do here; And namely, 1. When they are not ſenſible of obſtructions in the way, but are ſoon hindered; for ſo much ſpeaks their ſenſeleſſe ſubmiſſion in this particular. 2. When they neglect or paſſe from a known duty upon any pretence of Providence, or of Gods ſecret will: as here they leave off a commanded duty, alledging that Gods time was not come. 3. When they are hindered from their duty in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Work of God by any hazard whatſoever, if it were even by the command of miſinformed authority, eſpecially when they have clear law for what they do, as well as Gods command; for this was their fault, that they were hindered by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.23, 24. when they had <hi>Cyrus</hi> decree ſtanding for them, which <hi>Darius</hi> ſuſtaines, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.2, &amp;c. when they were challenged for building without a new warrant. 4 When they look for times wherein there ſhall be no difficulties, but all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for doing Gods work in, and in expectation of ſuch times do lie by from preſent duty; becauſe their times were not ſuch, they ſay, <hi>The time is not come;</hi> whereas his work go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on in the midſt of diſadvantages, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25. 5. When the true cauſe of mens negligence, which layeth many a lion in the way, is their love to their own things and private intereſts, carrying their ſpirits of publick matters and the things of God,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169977:11"/>and all that men ſay beſide, are but pretences to hide their ſhame; ſo much doth the Lord diſcover in their <hi>dwelling in ſiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſes;</hi> when his <hi>houſe lay waſte. Doct.</hi> 4 Mens own conſciences, when they ſpeak impartially, will convince them of hainous ſin, when they ſtudy to promote their own intereſts, who are but wormes, with the neglect of the great Gods affairs, when they are ſooner laid by in his matters then their own: when they can get time for their own affairs, and will not ſtand at any difficulty, but no time for Gods work, and every more there is a mountain; when they care little how it be with Gods houſe, ſo their own houſe proſper, and when they can live in pomp and eaſe, and make a good life for themſelves in an ill time, and let Gods work lie in the duſt, as that they can do nothing for, nor are ſenſible of, nor challenged for any neglect about it; This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in that pinching queſtion: <hi>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your ſieled houſes, and this houſe lie waſte?</hi> that is, can you finde a time and opportunity to raiſe your ſelves to ſuch ſtate, who are poor crawling wormes, and yet finde none ſo much as to raiſe the houſe of the great God out of the ruines thereof, and not be challenged? 5. A peoples ſinful negligence in Gods matters (eſpecially having received many favours from him) though times were never ſo perillous, renders them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, whatever their priviledges be, and provokes God to bring them down to know themſelves better; therefore he ſtiles them, <hi>This</hi> (not my) <hi>people,</hi> and <hi>O ye,</hi> to wit, baſe worms for whom I have done ſo much. 6. As God would be ſeen the ſinners Party, in diſcovering and reproving of ſin; ſo a ſight of his Majeſty and Power, who hath all things at his command to employ as his army, may terrifie the ſecure and negligent, and promiſe ſufficient protection to the willing doers of their duty, in times of greateſt hazard, from Tyrants and Oppreſſors; Therefore is his authority prefixed, both to the challenge and diſcovery of their ſin, <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord;</hi> and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, <hi>Then came the Word of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned <hi>the Lord of Hoſtes,</hi> able to cruſh them perſiſting in their ſin, and able to protect them in their duty againſt all their ill neighbours.</p>

                  <p>Having thus reproved their ſinful negligence, he exhorts to a ſerious conſideration of their courſe, and of their ingratitude, prophanity and careleſneſſe in this matter, that it might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, eſpecially conſidering the hand of God upon them, and that they were lying under ſome of the viſible curſes of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. Either the earth denied them increaſe, or God took away the bleſſing, that they were neither fed nor cloathed by it, and the fruit of their labours were put in a bottomleſſe bag, all which could not be without ſome cauſe, which they were to ſearch out, and lay to heart and amend. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A chief cauſe of a peoples going wrong, and continuing wrong, is the want of a ſerious examination of themſelves, to know how it is with them, and the want of a ſerious pondering and laying to heart of the ſinfulneſſe of theſe courſes, which otherwiſe they are not ſimply ignorant of; therefore here he exhorts them to this ſovereign remedy; <hi>Conſider your wayes,</hi> or, <hi>ſet your heart upon your wayes.</hi> 2. God hath the fruit of the earth, and of mens labours, and the bleſſing of what they have, ſo abſolutely in his hands, as that he can when he pleaſes take them away; can make a mans riches not to conſiſt in the abundance of what he poſſeſſeth; and will take them away when his people hunt after theſe things, neglecting better; for herein he would have his hand ſeen; <hi>Ye have ſowen much, and bring in little, ye cat, but ye have not enough, &amp;c.</hi> 3. When the Word of the Lord doth not diſcover effectually mens ſinful wayes unto them, the Lord uſeth to ſend affliction to put them upon a ſearch, and when rods are lying on, and God is executing his threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed curſes, it calls aloud to ſecure ſinners, to make enquiry into themſelves, that they may be humbled and amend their faults; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes, conſider your wayes: ye have ſowen much, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>He exhorts them yet again to conſider their wayes, and (that they might teſtifie their reality herein) to bring forth the fruit thereof, by obeying the Command of God, and going ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provide timber from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and materials to build the Temple: To which he ſubjoynes this encouragement, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe made, concerning the firſt Temple, and <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.28, 29. He would take pleaſure to ſhew himſelf gracious therein, as in his reſting place, and would be glorified by his peoples ſervice there, by his appearing gloriouſly for them from thence, and by getting praiſe from his people for the gracious anſwering of them in their need. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Self-examination is a duty from which men are naturally averſe, and a duty which is not often done to any good purpoſe, or ſo as from through conviction of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience they ſubſcribe themſelves guilty of what the Word chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges for, which yet is neceſſary for a right reformation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes: therefore it is preſſed again and again, <hi>Conſider your wayer.</hi> 2. As the Lord doth not approve of amendment of faults, without a ſerious laying to heart of former debordings; ſo kindly convictions will not die out, nor let the convinced ſinner alone, till it appear in fruits of outward obedience: for theſe two are joyned together; <hi>Conſider your wayes,</hi> and <hi>go up to the mountain, and bring wood.</hi> 3. It is the Will of God, that his people, as they be careful to have their own ſouls, and every one within their charge in a right way, ſo eſpecially to have the publick work and ſervice of God, wherein all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, ſet on foot and kept up: for this was in part, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uſe of this Ceremonial Temple, to be a place for Gods publick worſhip, concerning which all are commanded: <hi>Go up to the mountain, bring wood and build the houſe.</hi> 4. Where God evidenceth his preſence among a people, by ſetting up his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and publick worſhip among them, and makes them active in promoving the ſame, it is a pledge that he will not abhor them, but make his preſence knowen by gracious acts, that he will let out proofs of his glory there, accept their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as glory given to him, and give them frequent occaſion of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169977:12"/>glorifying him; for, <hi>Build the houſe, and I will take pleaſure in it, and I will be glorified, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 5. It may be a great encouragement to the Church, to do ſervice, that the all-ſufficient Lord ſhould condeſcend to accept any ſervice they can do, or own and take pleaſure in them or it; for, ſo doth the Lord encourage: <hi>Build the houſe, and I will take pleaſure in it,</hi> that is, your ſervice ſhall be owned, I will dwell in that which ye build; See, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27.</p>

                     </gap>d is again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate. 2. When the Lord is provoked, he can not only ſend an affliction, but ſo order it, by faire appearances of a better
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169977:13"/>lot, and heightening of the ſinners expectation and deſire, as may make it moſt ſad: <hi>Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little.</hi> 3. Sinners are never a whit the nearer contentment and happineſs, that they have theſe things which uſually men take for their portion of happineſſe; for by withdrawing a bleſſing God can make it all one, as if they had them not; <hi>And when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it.</hi> 4. Though impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, having felt ſome ſtroakes, may readily, becauſe of that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect exemption for the future; yet it is righteous with God to purſue them with rod upon rod, till they be compleatly miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, unleſſe they return; for, it is not enough, that the great harveſt they expected came to little, but that little is blaſted: <hi>I did blow upon it.</hi> 5. As when the Lord ſtrikes his owne people, there muſt be ſome ſpecial and remarkable cauſe to be ſought out; ſo the ſtupidity of a ſtricken people, is ordinarily ſo great, that they can neither ſearch nor finde it out, till God diſcover it; this queſtion, <hi>Why, ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes?</hi> doth not import any ignorance in him, but that it was their duty to ſearch the cauſe, and yet could not finde it out without his light. 6. The true cauſe of the Church and Profeſſors, their ill thriving in the world, is, that their care of theſe things takes them up from minding Gods work and matters, and that they are taken up with the worſt things, neglecting the beſt: thus to ſeek to gaine is indeed to loſe, for zeal for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and work of God, is the compendious way to proſper in our private affaires: this is the true cauſe of their want; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my houſe that is waſte, and ye run every man to his own houſe.</hi> 7. It is uſeful for ſecure ſinners, being afflicted by God, to take a ſerious view of the rods upon them, that they may ſee more of the bitter fruits of ſin, then can be diſcerned at firſt: therefore doth the Lord repeat and inlarge the ſight of their ſtroak, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. that therein they might ſee God provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to be their Party in whoſe favour their life ſtood; <hi>I called for a drought:</hi> that they might ſee all the creatures armed, and ready to execute Gods quarrel for ſin: <hi>Heaven ſtayed from dew, and the earth from fruit,</hi> both conſpiring the ſinners ruine; that they might ſee mans frailty, (however he be oft-times ſtout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God) in that there is no need of ſtriking him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but take away one of many drops from him, and he is gone, ſtay but the heavens from dew, and the earth, from raine and fruit, and man will ſmart for all; that they might ſee that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169977:13"/>vengeance purſuing ſin, will cut a man ſhort of all his contents and refuges on all hands, will blaſt a land and all the fruits of it, will ſinite man and beaſt, and all his labour, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and in a word, the afflicted ſinner may ſee that it is great folly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Lord to jealouſie, and that there is no ſafety, but in being reconciled with God, and ſetting about duty.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The fruit and ſucceſſe of this doctrine is recorded, that the Rulers and remnant of the Jewes, who were left of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſore judgements, or who had returned from captivity, did acknowledge the voice of God in the mouth of his ſervant, though there had been no Prophets ſent of a long time before: and out of the ſenſe of their guilt, and juſtneſſe of Gods judgements, did ſtand in awe of God ſpeaking to them, and did ſubmit to the Command, and go to work. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Word of God in the mouth of his ſervants will not take effect till his authority be ſeen and acknowledged in it, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants looked on as coming in his Name; for here they look on this meſſage, <hi>as the voice of the Lord, and the words of Haggai as the Lord had ſent him,</hi> that is, that the Lords voice was in his Word whom he had ſent. 2. It will be a notable meanes to make the Word effectual, when beſide the abſolute authority of God, ſpeaking in his Word, his intereſt in his people is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and believed by them, and that he who ſpeaks, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and directs, is their Confederate God, whom they ſhould be loath to offend or diſobey, ſo much the rather as his relation ſtands, notwithſtanding their faults; for, thus is the Lord named here, <hi>The Lord their God.</hi> 3. When God is ſeen ſpeaking in his Word as a Party to the ſinner, and when his love is believed for all that, even in his reproving it will make the guilty and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſinner, to ſtand in much awe, will both break and melt him, and will make him look on his former wayes, wherein he hath lien ſecure, with much affrightment and horrour; for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169977:14"/>fruit of the former is; <hi>And the people feared before the Lord.</hi> 4. When the awe of God, ſpeaking in his Word, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and goodneſſe, hath had place in the heart, it will put men to give obedience in ſome meaſure to what is commanded; for, the people in this temper <hi>obeyed the voice of the Lord.</hi> 5. It is a ſweet and bleſſed like caſe, when men in power are patternes and encouragements unto others, in ſubmitting to the Word of the Lord in the mouth of his ſervants, and when a peoples affliction doth not hinder their reſpect to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, as here is marked: that <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> firſt, and then all <hi>the remnant of the people obeyed.</hi> 6. It may encourage the ſervants of God to go on in their work, when they conſider what a great bleſſing God can, and ſometime doth give to their endeavours beyond all probability: for here, by one Sermon, all the people are ſet about a long neglected work, in the midſt of many difficulties.</p>

As the people of God no ſooner put hand to any work of his, but they are invironed with ſo many difficulties within and without, that they will need to ſetch their encouragement from God only, ſo the Lords peace and approbation, his preſence, bleſſing and aſſiſtance, which he aſſuredly gives his own people in his way, is ſufficient to bear out in hardeſt ſervice: in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to all they could meet with, this aſſurance is given; <hi>I am with you, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 3.

However choiceſt of men or people conſidered in themſelves, or being left of God, will prove baſe and unable, and unwilling for any good work; yet when the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt are ſet on work by God, they will be couragious to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and able to effectuate great things; for when God <hi>ſtirred up the ſpirits,</hi> of that ſeemingly deſpicable people; <hi>They came and did work in the houſe of the Lord,</hi> which was an enterpriſe full of hazard. 3.

As a people ſleighting the Lords work, are juſtly contemptible in his ſight, ſo when they fall to duty, they become precious in his ſight, and he is tender of their afflictions: for now they are not <hi>this people,</hi> as <hi>chap.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>but the reſidue of the people.</hi> 4. Satan is ſo violent and ſo active an enemie to a work of Reformation, and our hearts ſo unfit for going about it, that when other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments faile, he will fetch diſcouragements from mens own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mindes, and the work it ſelf, as nothing anſwerable to their expectation, and ſo be in peril to make it be laid aſide when none other would hinder it: for this is a new impediment laid in the way, that the houſe was nothing like the former. 5. Our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods work by outward appearances, and looking upon it with a carnal eye, is a great enemie to reformation, while we conſider not that the more ſpiritual glory Chriſt is about to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169977:16"/>in his Church, the leſſe viſible glory will he let appear, becauſe it would take out heart off the other: this was their tentation; <hi>Is it not in our eyes in compariſon of it as nothing?</hi> as judging of prophecies according to ſenſe, whereas Chriſt by taking away of ſome of the outward glory, was making way for the greater ſpiritual glory of the Temple.</p>

                  <p>The exhortation is yet preſſed, and this firſt ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement confirmed: The Covenant made with them when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſtood yet in force to aſſure them of his preſence; and as they had ſeen in the deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> what God would and could do for his confederate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo the ſame God was by his Spirit and power preſent with them: or ſtanding (as the word is) ready for employment, whereof ſome evidences were given in the ſending out a Spirit of prophecie, and conſequently they needed not feare. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Faithleſſe and ſlaviſh feare is a principal cauſe of much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, and will muſter up many diſcouragements and lions in the way of our duty, to hinder us from it, and therefore is to be ſet againſt; <hi>Feare ye not.</hi> 2. It may guard the heart of the Lords people againſt ſinful feare, to conſider that their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are not left in uncertainty, but are made ſure to them by a Covenant, which ſtands firme, notwithſtanding ſad dayes, and will be forth-coming for them in due effects; ſo doth the Lord here ſpeak of their mercie and the Covenant; <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Word that I covenanted with you, when ye came out of Egypt, ſo my Spirit remaineth among you.</hi> 3. The former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods appearing for his confederate people, do ſtand firme as a ground of comfort to them, in following exigents; (however their caſe and temper may alter) conſidering his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted immutability, and that theſe things were done not for their worth, but becauſe of his free love: therefore doth the Lord hold forth what was done, <hi>when they came out of Egypt,</hi> as a ground for their preſent expectations. 4.

                  <p>As the firſt ground of encouragement ſpeaks chiefly to the exhortation, and that they ſhould go on; ſo this ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly meets with their tentation, ariſing from the meanneſſe of the work, which he undertakes to make up with the glory of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, and the ſpiritual things of his Kingdome, which ſhould begin in and under the time of that ſecond Temple: and promiſeth, that as of old when he gave the Law, he ſhook the earth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.18. ſo now again, within a-ſhort time, he would ſhake both heaven and earth, and all Nations, to make way for the coming of Chriſt, who is the light, and life, and deſire of all the Elect among the Nations, and for their bringing unto him, who promiſeth here to fill the ſecond Temple with glory, by his being preſented there unto the Lord at his birth, by his publick teaching there, and by the promulgation of the Goſpel in his Church, prefigured by that Temple, and in part during the ſtanding thereof. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>ſhaking</hi> hath relation not only to the great commotions and alterations, (uſually repreſented in the Old Teſtament as a day of diſſolution of heaven and earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.13. and 34.4. every ſtate having ſomewhat eminent, reſembling an heaven: and ſomewhat inferiour reſembling an earth in it,) that befell that people and other ſtates about, to make way for Chriſts coming, according to the foregoing prophecies: or to the ſhaking of heaven by his deſcenſion and aſcenſion, and by the joy and admiration of Angels, and the commotion of the Jewes on earth, at the report of his birth; or to the fignes in heaven and earth (ſuch as darkneſſe, earth-quakes, &amp;c.) at his death and reſurrection: but alſo to the great change wrought by the preaching of the Goſpel, ſhaking looſe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the alterable eſtate, and ceremonies of the Jewiſh Church, repreſented here by <hi>heaven,</hi> that room may be made for a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169977:18"/>new ſtate of the Church, or Kingdome of Heaven, wherein all Nations might have intereſt, and which ſhould not be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſhaking the world in all the parts of it ſucceſſively, both Iſlands and Continents, by the preaching of the Goſpel, crying down idols, and (as men interpreted) turning the world up-ſide down, and ſhaking the Elects hearts throughout the world, making them to flee in to Chriſt, as the Hebrew read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>v.</hi> 7. will bear; <hi>I will ſhake all Nations, and they ſhall come to the deſire of all Nations,</hi> who is to be manifeſted in that Temple, and bring themſelves and their deſirable things with them according to the prophecies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. and elſewhere, which will be ſtill in doing from age to age, and Nation to Nation, till once for all, God ſhake and remove theſe viſible heavens and earth, as ſome expound that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26, 27. which is indeed the full accompliſhment of the prediction, but the place doth alſo include theſe other ſhakings, to bring in a Goſpel-ſtate and worſhip into the world, as previous to that. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſh, is in himſelf the only deſirable and lovely one; ſo it is he in whom all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as Jewes, have a right; who if he were knowen, would be ſeen deſirable, and the only choice of all; and whom his own in all Nations ſhall be made to deſire and flee unto, till the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be all brought in: ſo is he here deſcribed, <hi>the deſire of all Nations,</hi> as well <hi>as the Lord whom the Jewes ſought,</hi> Mal. 3.1. not with relation to any deſire of him, any Nation beſide the Jewes actually had before he came, but with relation to his excellencie, to his purpoſes concerning them, and to what the event of his manifeſtation ſhould be, according to that prophecie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. 2. The promiſed Meſſiah and Saviour of the world, his coming in our fleſh to perfect the work of our Redemption, was to be performed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſtanding of the ſecond Temple, and within a ſhort while after their captivity, being compared with the time that had paſt ſince he was promiſed to their fathers, till that time; for, it is <hi>a little while, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and I will fill the houſe, &amp;c.</hi> The time being now confined to <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeventy weeks: ſo that the Jewes who underſtand this place of the Meſſiah, and yet deny that he is yet come, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many hundreds of yeares, do bewray the blindneſſe and hardneſſe of their hearts. 3. The way of Gods worſhip and of the Church, eſtabliſhed by Chriſt at his coming in the fleſh,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169977:18"/>is ſuch, as however there may be many commotions even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the end of the world, for its getting footing where it had none, and its reſtoring where it hath been diſpoſſeſſed; yet in its own nature is unalterable, and is to continue without any new formes or wayes, till God once for all ſhake and diſſolve hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth: for, however after that ſhaking at <hi>Sinai</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law, there was to be a new ſhaking of the ceremonial Law, to make room for the Goſpel-way: yet it was to be but <hi>yet once,</hi> and no alteration after that. 4. As the Lord will ſhake and overturn all things before his Word faile, and his people want promiſed help, and as all Nations have their owne time of ſhaking and commotions: ſo every ſuch caſe doth not ſpeak ruine, but ſometime is the fore-runner of Chriſts coming in a Goſpel-reformation, eſpecially where Chriſt becomes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and deſirable unto a people; therefore to confirme the Jewes, doth he hold forth his power employed for fulfilling his promiſes, and that in this order, as <hi>to ſhake heaven and earth, &amp;c.</hi> and then <hi>the deſire of all Nations ſhall come.</hi> 5. As there is much oppoſition lying in Chriſt his Kingdom and Goſpels way in the world, and eſpecially in mens own ſtubborn hearts, which he both can and will remove, where he hath a purpoſe of good to any: ſo there muſt be ſtrange ſhakings of Nations and perſons, before Chriſt and the Goſpel can have their due place or employment: therefore <hi>he ſhakes heaven and earth, and all Nations,</hi> ere this great mercy can have place, or they be fit for it, that <hi>the deſire of all Nations come.</hi> 6. Chriſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh, and his preſence in his Goſpel, makes up the want of all outward viſible glory amongſt a people, and the want of external pompe in worſhip: for, in oppoſition to their mean thoughts of their work, it is promiſed: <hi>the deſire of all Nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory;</hi> yea, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Goſpel is more glorious then that of the Law, in regard that in giving the Law he only <hi>ſhook the earth,</hi> but now both <hi>heavek</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> as it is expounded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.26. 7. Chriſt the promiſed Meſſiah, as he was to be true man, bone of our bone; ſo was he alſo from eternity very God Jehovah, equal in power and glory with the Father, who was converſant by his Spirit with his own people, and had a care of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his incarnation: for he, whoſe preſence was to make up the glory of the Temple is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and here himſelf promiſeth, <hi>I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes,</hi> which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169977:19"/>is Chriſts ſpeech, to whom we come in the Goſpel, as is cleared further, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24, 25, 26.</p>

                  <p>The third ground of encouragement raiſeth the promiſe of glory mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 7. yet higher, and meets with a particular rcaſon of their tentation; for whereas they complained of the want of gold and ſilver wherewith to adorn the Temple, and make it ſtately, as in <hi>Solomons</hi> dayes; the Lord declares, that if he accounted that to be the true glory of his Church, and took pleaſure in that carnal ſplendor, he could eaſily be at the expences, having as much at his command, as in <hi>Solomous</hi> dayes; but did refrain from that now, as purpoſing to traine them up for a greater glory of the ſecond Temple, by Chriſts preſence and ſpiritual gifts poured out, (of which all the glory of the firſt Temple was but a ſhadow,) and particularly, by the preaching of the doctrine of reconciliation and ſpiritual peace by the death of Jeſus Chriſt which ſhould begin there, and from thence go through the world. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The abſolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the riches and ſplendor of the world belongs unto the Lord, who hath all theſe things in his power to diſpoſe of as he pleaſes, and who is to be eyed, acknowledged and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto by every man in his portion and lot, according as he diſpenſeth it: for, <hi>the ſilver is mine and the gold is mine, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 2. It may ſatisfie the people of God in their wants, to conſider that God hath all they want at his command, and would not withhold it, unleſſe he ſaw ſuch a diſpenſation tending to their good; to meet with the Jewes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of poverty; <hi>the ſilver is mine, &amp;c. ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 3. When the Lord withholds any glory or ſplendor, from his people and work, it is for their advantage, and flowes from a purpoſe to give what is better, if they had eyes to ſee it; for when he withholds ſilver and gold which they ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169977:19"/>he purpoſeth that <hi>the glory of this latter houſe ſhall be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then of the former.</hi> 4. The ſpiritual things of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do far ſurpaſſe all the legal adminiſtrations in glory, and do put more real ſplendor on any place where they are adminiſtred, then all the pomp of the world beſide can do: <hi>the glory of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houſe ſhall be greater then of the former, ſaith the Lord of hoſts:</hi> for there, there was but a <hi>Solomon,</hi> here a greater then <hi>Solomon:</hi> there was gold and worldly ſplendour, here heavenly treaſures ſhined: there was the miniſtration of the letter, here of the Spirit; there a precious ointment, here the oile of gladneſſe; there God dwelt in thick darkneſſe, here the light of the world ſhined; and in a word, there were the dark ſhadowes, here the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. 5. As peace and reconciliation with God, is the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſts ſubjects, which out-ſhines all the ſplendour and glory of the world; ſo it is the great glory of the Goſpel-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, that by them peace may be had through Jeſus Chriſt, which was attainable by none of the works and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law being reſted on; therefore in ſtead of their wonted ſplendour, and in oppoſition to former adminiſtrations, it is promiſed, that by Chriſts coming, his death and doctrine; <hi>In this place will I give peace, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi>

All that is written in the Law concerning ceremonial pollution, is but a ſhadow and repreſentation of the moral uncleanneſſe of men; which the ſenſible ſoul wil finde as difficult, (if not more) to avoid, as the Jewes found that, while it put them to a perpetual affrightment and caution: therefore <hi>Haggai</hi> by the one, points at the other as the ſubſtance, and ſheweth that the ſame proportion holds in both. 2. It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable way for effectual convincing of ſin, to make uſe of any principles of light that are in men, and by them to draw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions upon the conſcience; ſo doth <hi>Haggai</hi> make uſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169977:20"/>and ruled caſes, from which he inferres a guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which they did not ſo clearly ſee. 3. As the lips of the ſervants of God are to preſerve knowledge, and they are to be made uſe of by his people, in reſolution of difficulties; ſo they are not to be looked on as infallible guides, as if every thing they ſay, they could not erre in it, but they are to ſpeak from the Word, and their Doctrine to be examined by it; for this is the will of the Lord of hoſtes, that we <hi>aske the Prieſts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law.</hi> 4. Such as rightly examine themſelves will eaſily perceive the great difficulty there is of good, in compariſon of ill, and how they are farre more eaſily polluted then ſanctified: ſo much do both caſes hold out, that holineſſe extended no further at beſt then the garment which immediately touched the holy thing, but pollution reached further. 5. External per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, whether of Gods worſhip or in his publick work, will not of it ſelf make a man acceptable; but on the contrary, want of perſonal reconciliation and purity will pollute beſt works will render the workers contemptible, and all they do vile; ſo doth the Lord teach us, that by reaſon of former and preſent pollution, <hi>So</hi> (to wit <hi>unclean</hi>) <hi>is this Nation before me, ſaith the Lord, and ſo is every work of their hands, and that which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer there is unclean.</hi> 6 It is a profitable ſtudy when people are about works that are in themſelves right, to be ſenſible not only of former failings and neglects, but of preſent uncleanneſſe which they may contract in them; and for this end to ſearch what they are in the ſight of God, that they may be humbled, and not delude nor pleaſe themſelves with the bare work; for this end comes this Sermon out that ſame day they were ready to build, that they might not ſo ſoon forget their former way, nor be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull that there was more required for approbation, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imployed in an holy work.</p>

                  <p>The ſcope of the ſecond part of this Sermon, is to ſhew that however God will put difference betwixt workers; and knoweth who are ſincere, and who not, yet to encourage them to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in it, as being a work which he approves in it ſelf, and which he will reward with temporal bleſſing and a change of his former diſpenſations. And therefore he ſtirres them up to remarke the tokens of Gods anger on them while they neglected the Temple, <hi>v.</hi> 15. that their expectations of the harveſt, and what they had gathered, were much diſappointed, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and the Lord, with the drought, Chap. 1.11. had otherwayes alſo ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the fruits of the ground, whereof they had made no good uſe, <hi>v.</hi> 17. but now having begun the work, <hi>v.</hi> 18. he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſend a bleſſing on the fruits of the ground, and this he doth in the midſt of winter when their ſeed was ſown and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had budded, and conſeqently nothing could be foretold of the enſuing harveſt, but by God only; that ſo by obſerving the ſubſequent ſeaſons and the harveſt it ſelfe, they might be confirmed in the faith of Gods approving their work, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in it, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the Lords diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be viſible and felt by all, yet the right conſidering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them is a work of much difficulty, and to which men need ſerious ſtirring up, eſpecially to take up the right cauſe of them; therefore after all the pointing out of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition in the former Sermons, they are again invited to conſider it, <hi>I pray you conſider, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Famine and ſcarcity is one of the publick ſcourges whereby the Lord chaſtiſeth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169977:21"/>contempt and negligence of his people in his work and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and he will be conſpicuous in inflicting of it; for, <hi>Before a ſtone was laid on a ſtone in the Temple of the Lord, when one cams to an heap of twenty meaſures, there were but ten, &amp;c. I ſmote you with blaſting, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As it is the uſual plague accompanying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon judgements that they do not work upon the hearts of men, to draw them nearer God, but rather harden them: ſo ſuch an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent diſpoſition when God ſtrikes, is a ground of further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; therfore he marks by the way their ſtupidity, <hi>Yet ye turned not to me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> 4. However temporal things are not to be looked on as the chief reward of ſerving God, nor as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely promiſed, nor yet are they to be ſo much looked to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, as the Church of the Jewes might under their pedagogy; yet in this the promiſe, even concerning theſe things, holds good, that following of God hath the promiſe of this life, in ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rre as it is for the followers good; that Gods chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging adverſity into proſperity when a people ſet about his work, ſhould be a confirmation to their faith and ſtrengthen their hands that whatever adverſity come on the Church, it is not to be fathered on Gods work, as if it had been the cauſe of her wo; that as neglecters of Gods work are reall loſers in their own affaires, and will prove ſo in the end; ſo followers of his work, have a reall advantage in it; and in a word, that Gods work is never followed without a bleſſing evidenced ſome way or other to the godlies ſatisfaction; This much we may learn from this particular promiſe made to the Church of the Jewes, whereas they had been formerly much afflicted, now, <hi>from this day will I bleſſe you.</hi> 5. It is a profitable ſtudy, to remark the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of following God, and to ſtudy encouragement in that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo much are we taught by the Lords exciting them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the change of his dealing, as tryſting with the very day of their amending their fault. 6. God is ſo ſovereigne and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a Lord of all things, and hath times and ſeaſons, bleſſings and curſings ſo in his hand, as he may undertake to do things, whereof there is no viſible probability or certainty in the ſecond cauſes, and can certainly perform them; therefore doth he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to bleſſe them, when ſecond cauſes and the ſeaſon could ſpeak no ſuch thing. 7. It is the prerogative of God only to know future contingent events, which depend on times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and uncertaine ſecond cauſes; and are known by men by no ſtudy of ſecond cauſes, and their influences, but only by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169977:22"/>revelation; this is held forth as Gods prerogative by his extraordinary Prophet, to foretell in the midſt of winter, what the ſucceeding harveſt ſhould produce.</p>

                  <p>The laſt Sermon, delivered on the ſame day with the former, may be underſtood of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> the type, unto whom is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for the behoofe of his ſucceſſors and that people, that whereas God was about to ſend great commotions, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to overthrow Kingdomes of the world and their power, ſetting them by the eares among themſelves; yet he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, and that people governed by him, as his precious jewels, and as his choſen people, eſpecially becauſe Chriſt the ſubſtance of this type, was to come of them. And ſo we <hi>learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of the Lords watchmen to approve themſelves before him in their diligent and active going about their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and preaching the Word of the Lord inſtantly; for <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai</hi> is here ſent out <hi>again</hi> upon the ſame day he had the former Sermon. 2. As the office of Magiſtracy, eſpecially over the Lords people, is no eaſie work; ſo honeſt Magiſtrates ſhall have
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169977:22"/>their own peculiar encouragements from God; Therefore is <hi>Haggai</hi> commanded to <hi>ſpeak to Zerubbabel governour of Judah.</hi> 3. Honeſt Magiſtrates will be ſelfe-denied, and will look on their publick charge as if it were their own particular, ſo that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours promiſed and conferred on the people they govern, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of encouragement to them; for this promiſe made to <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> was not accompliſhed to himſelfe nor in his time, but to the people under his ſucceſſors, when the Perſian and Grecian Monarchies were overturned, and all the Kingdomes on every hand were reeling, and threatening ruine to the Church amongſt the reſt; and yet this is his encouragement, as if all had tended to his own particular behoofe. 4. As the Kingdomes of the children of men, even of very Pagans, are at Gods diſpoſal to lettle or remove them as he pleaſes; ſo theſe moſt eminent dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, are but uncertaine things, obnoxious to many alterations, wherein neither authority nor power will hinder Gods purpoſe, nor will meanes be wanting, ſo long as there is one Nation to daſh upon another: ſo much is held out in this promiſe, <hi>I will ſhake heaven and earth, and I will overthrow the threne of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Albeit the Church may ſeem to have reaſon to fear her enemies, when they are in power, and to fear the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions that are in the world about her, leſt ſhe being a weak party, come down with the reſt, yet in her weakeſt condition ſhe may expect preſervation in the midſt of combuſtions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where God hath any further work to do in her; for as the Church of the Jewes, lying in the midſt of tottering Kingdomes, eſpecially of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> (which ſeemed moſt to threaten her ruine) gets a promiſe that <hi>in that day</hi> of common combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe ſhall be <hi>as a ſignet;</hi> becauſe Chriſt was to be born in her: ſo may every particular viſible Church expect, who hath Chriſt myſtical in his members to bring forth to God. 6. The Church is to confirm her own faith in the truth of promiſes, by conſidering not what ſhe is in her ſelfe, or what her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can promiſe, but by looking to what Gods power, and providence can make her, and do for her; for ſo the promiſe runnes, <hi>I will take thee, and make thee as a ſignet,</hi> be what thou will in thy ſelfe. The fountaine of all the Churches happineſſe, lies in her having a room in the Lords intimate affection, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her precious in his ſight, and being forth-coming for what is good to hen; of which the Church is to take faſt hold, and read every diſpenſation by; for all the favours intended
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169977:23"/>to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and in him to the people, is ſummed up in this, <hi>I will make thee as a ſignet;</hi> which imports great reſpect and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as to a ring and jewel, which being on the finger, is ſtill in the poſſeſſors ſight and kept diligently, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.24. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. 8. As obedience is the way of obtaining favour, ſo the ground of all reſpects and favours flowing from it to the Church, is Gods free chooſing of her, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to be the object of his tender love; and of the mercies which love allowes on her, which the Church is to look unto and not to any thing in her ſelfe, therefore is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Zerubbabel my ſervant</hi> and the reaſon given, <hi>For I have choſen thee, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The promiſe may alſo more fitly be underſtood of Chriſt the ſubſtance, who was in <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> loines, and whoſe type <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> was in his Government; and ſo the promiſe holds out the ſame in ſubſtance with what we heard, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. to wit, that God was about to work great alterations in the heaven, or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious external forme of the Jewiſh Church: and in the earth and kingdomes of men, ſetting them one againſt another, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their power, and bringing them down, and all for Chriſts behoofe, that he as the choſen ſervant of the Father, and his Church may be ſeen to be precious, and become glorious by ſtability and enlargement. <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. Chriſt the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Meſſiah is the true Sonne and ſucceſſor of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, the ſweet Governour and King of his Church, and he who is the conductor of his people out of their ſpiritual bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and captivity; for theſe cauſes is he ſpoken to under the name of <hi>Zerubbabel Governour of Judah.</hi> 2. The promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Churches happineſſe are made unto Chriſt as the Fathers party, who having purchaſed them by his obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, is alſo able to ſecure them to his people; therefore this promiſe is made to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> in the type. 3. Albeit the Lord was author and enjoyner of the external forme of the Jewiſh worſhip, and the Covenant made with them is the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with the Covenant of the New Teſtament; yet it was not the will of God that the externall way of adminiſtration of the Convenant among them ſhould endure under the Kingdome of the Meſſiah, who was by his death to put an end to theſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes; for, <hi>I will ſhake the heavens,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be many toſſings in the world where Chriſt comes with his Goſpel, yet his Kingdome will be no loſer by them,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169977:23"/>but will be the Lords delight, which he will adorne with theſe ruines, by making it to ſtand while others fall, by bringing down oppoſition and enemies, and dantoning and breaking men, that they may more eaſily embrace the Goſpel, and he may make conqueſts upon them; therefore when he makes all theſe overturnings, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>In that day I will make thee as a ſignet,</hi> v. 23. glorious, precious, and ſafely kept. 5. The foundation of the Churches happineſs ſtands on Chriſts having been obedient to his Father as her ſurety, on his intereſt in the Fathers affection, and that he is the only choſen way of her ſafety, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath found out, and wherein he acquieſceth, and in all theſe that Hee to be hid in him; therefore is all the happineſs of the Goſpel-Church ſummed up in this, <hi>I will take thee, O Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and make thee as a ſignet, for I have choſen thee, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Prophet being to carry comfortable tidings to this people, begins-with the doctrine of repentance, inviting them not to obſtruct their own mercie by impenitencie: and to make way for this doctrine, he points out to them the greatneſſe of Gods diſpleaſure againſt their fathers for their ſin, as might be ſeen in the horrible calamities that did come upon them, which might teach their children not to expect exemption if they followed their way. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A people are prepared and fitted for favourable manifeſtations of God, by repentance; and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are ſweeteſt and moſt comfortable unto penitents, therfore the Lord premits this doctrine to the following viſions, as the only way to fit people for them, and make them truly comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them. 2. No priviledge beſtowed upon any people, will exempt them from ſharp corrections when they ſin; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Jewes were the only people of God at that time, yet <hi>the Lord hath been ſore diſpleaſed with your fathers,</hi> which is alſo a warning to them. 3 Though the Lord do not chaſtiſe any of his choſen and regenerate people in pure wrath, or beyond the bounds of moderation; yet his fatherly diſpleaſure may be very hot and ſad in its effects, and his diſpleaſure againſt a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, which hath abuſed mercy very grievous, and therefore ought to be ſeriouſly laid to heart; therefore he calls them to conſider how <hi>the Lord hath been ſore diſpleaſed, or had diſpleaſure on diſpleaſure.</hi> 4. Albeit examples of Gods anger, eſpecially when they are near, ought to be effectual documents to others, exciting to tremble and repent, yet ſuch is the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of men, that notwithſtanding any ſuch warming, they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169977:25"/>will be ready to adventure on the ſame ſins, which God hath ſo remarkably puniſhed; therefore they need ſtirring up to ſee and make uſe of Gods anger againſt their fathers, the effects whereof were very viſible to them.</p>

                  <p>The Lord ſubjoynes the uſe of the former example, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to repentance, to which he encourages them by his own invitation, and promiſe of being reconciled to them, and of dealing favourably with them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Judgements right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudied, do call for repentance as the only remedy, and ought not to harden, ſtupifie, or provoke to murmuring, which aggredges ſin, and ripens for more judgements; upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine in <hi>v.</hi> 2. is inferred, <hi>therefore turn ye unto me, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 2. It may be a great encouragement to the guilty ſinner to repent, to conſider, that the Lord not only allowes, but calls him to it; and that he is moſt excellent to whom the penitent ſinner comes; therefore God interpoſes in this, <hi>Say unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord, turne ye,</hi> and thrice deſignes himſelf <hi>the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 3. True penitents, and ſouls indeed ſenſible of ſin, will diſcern, that ſin hath not only cauſed a diſtance betwixt God and them, but an alienation of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them, and that their back is turned on God, and will not only loath, but renounce their ſinful way, not reſting on any thing, till they attain to communion and reconciliation with God: ſo much is imported in this deſcription of repentance; <hi>Turn ye unto me.</hi> 4. The Lord, in letting out his diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, doth not caſt off thoughts of mercy, but chaſtiſeth them, that he may drive them to his mercy, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repentance he is ready to manifeſt: <hi>Turn ye unto me, and I will turn unto you.</hi> 5. The Lord in ſuſpending his turning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us till we repent, doth not import that we can repent of our ſelves: but his ſcope is to convince us of our duty, and make us ſenſible of our inability, that we may flee to him, and then he will both turn us and turn to us; thus are we to underſtand this order of his command and promiſe; <hi>Turn ye and I will turn:</hi> See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. 6. No outward diſpenſation or token of favour can be comfortable, or promiſe that things ſhall

                  <p>A ſecond exhortation is, that they would not imitate their perverſe fathers, of whom they were deſcended, in contemning the admonitions to repentance given them by the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which is alſo an argument inviting them to repent, who were come of ſuch Progenitors. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Cuſtome and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in a ſinful way, is ſo far from being a warrant to others to imitate it; that on the contrary, when men conſider the ill diſpoſition they have from their Progenitors, the power of inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ſinful cuſtome, and how much old debt is lying upon them, who walk in ſuch pathes, it may be a ſpecial motive to repentance, and getting out of ſuch a courſe: therefore ſaith he to the Jewes who gloried of their fathers, <hi>Be not as your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is an uſual lot of the Lords faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to labour in vaine in outward appearance, and it is an old ſin of the viſible Church, to contemn the Word of God in their mouth, of which poſterity is to be aware: therefore he inſtances this ſin of their fathers which they are to avoid: that <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets cried, but they did not heare.</hi> 3 As it ſpeaks much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long-ſuffering in God, to warne a ſinful people of their danger; ſo theſe who are ſent out in that employment, ought to be faithful, bold and free, enforcing their doctrine from the divine authority of the Word; for as their ſinful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had <hi>the former Prophets,</hi> ſo <hi>they cried, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 4. The Lord requires of ſuch as would approve themſelves true penitents, that their turning to God, and reformation, flow from a ſerious conviction of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their debordings; the Prophets doctrine was not only to turne, but <hi>turne ye from your evil wayes, and from your evil,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169977:26"/>doings,</hi> that is, their courſes which they ought to look upon as groſſe. 5. As ſome may come to that height of ſin in the Church, as not to give an care to the Lords meſſage; and as none can prove themſelves hearers, who make not ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of giving obedience; ſo inadvertency, and not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering who ſpeaks, and what is ſpoken, is a cauſe why the Word hath ſo ill ſucceſſe; <hi>They did not hear,</hi> (either would not give an eare, or did not obey) <hi>nor hearken</hi> (to wit, attentively) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</hi> 6.

When the Lord honours a people by ſending his Word unto them, it is their part ſerionſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and lay to heart, the authority and certainty thereof, that they may take heed that they dallie not with God ſpeaking therein, and ſo deceive themſelves; for this end doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in the beginning of his Miniſtery, ſo ſeriouſly inculcate the truth and certainty of the Word from former experience. 2.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever encouragement to ſin, men gather from the evil example of others, yet a right view of the iſſue of their way, may convince them of follie who follow it: for, <hi>your fathers,</hi> (of whom ye boaſt, and whom ye will imitate) <hi>where are they?</hi> 4. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority and certainty of the Word doth not depend upon, nor is to be judged by the condition of the men who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to carry it: their frailty doth not diminiſh its perfection, their baſeneſſe doth not take away its authority, their outward hard lots will not hinder it from having effect, and their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and death will not hinder it to be immortal, and take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all ages; for, <hi>though the Prophets do not live for ever, yet my Word did take hold, &amp;c.</hi> when they were gone it lived. 5.

Things ſpiritual cannot be ſeen of us while we are within time, but darkly, and as through a glaſſe; ſo much doth this way of repreſenting things ſpiritual by things bodily teach us. 4. As the eternal Son of God had his delights among the children of men, before the earth was made; ſo from age to age before his Incarnation, he gave proof unto his Church, what pleaſure he had in her, and to become a man, and be found in the forme of a ſervant for her ſake: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from this, that he who is the Angel of the Lord, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor for his Church, <hi>v.</hi> 12. who hath Angels attending him, and at his command, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 11. yea, who is <hi>Jehovah, v.</hi> 20.

Though Chriſts preſence in his Church be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wanting to ſenſe, and little diſcerned by moſt, nor fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by enemies: yet they who have open eyes may ſee him in the Church in the darkeſt houre: this is held out to us in that the Prophet <hi>even by night ſaw a man among the myrtle trees:</hi> neither the night (taking it figuratively for their dark condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) nor the dark ſhadow, could hide him from the men illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate by God. 7.

                  <p>So much of this viſion is expounded, as was at that time for the Churches behoof, and is given by Chriſt under the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, of an Angel talking with the Prophet, who is the ſame with the man among the myrtle trees, as appears, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and it is he who intercedes for the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. and gives the Prophet a Commiſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 14. which is only Chriſts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169977:28"/>Prerogative. And ſo he repreſents Chriſt in his Prophetick office, who before appeared as Head of the Church on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back: he being enquired at by the Prophet, undertakes to informe him, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and accordingly teaches him concerning his Omniſcience and Sovereign Providence in the world, that he exactly conſiders the condition of all countreys and men, and how all the world about are at eaſe except the Church, all which is repreſented by the type of Angels ſent forth to view the world, as great Kings do their Intelligencers and Agents, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and by their returning an account of their diligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worlds quiet condition, <hi>v</hi> 11. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As Chriſt is appointed King and Head, ſo alſo to be the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Teacher of his Church and people, who hath revealed the Father, and his counſel concerning mans ſalvation, and who muſt be the teacher of all thoſe who would inſtruct his people to any purpoſe; for, the man among the myrtle-trees, is alſo <hi>the Angel that talked with the Prophet.</hi> 2. As the Lord exalts none to much communion with himſelf, but they need ſomewhat to abaſe them, and keep them in minde of their owne wants; ſo in a ſpecial manner, as men grow in a right way of knowledge, they will alſo grow in the humbling ſenſe of their own ignorance: therefore the Prophet being exalted to ſee viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, findes his own Ignorance, and is put to propound queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>O my Lord, what are theſe?</hi> 3. As Chriſt hath all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom and knowledge to ſolve every difficulty; ſo he is willing to clear every dark caſe to his people, who humbly imploy him, in ſo far as is needful and for their good; for, his anſwer to the Prophets queſtion is, <hi>I will ſhew thee what theſe be.</hi> 4 Angels are at Chriſts command, to come and go at his pleaſure, and he is their Head, to whom they are ſubject and accountable, and their promptitude and obedience unto him is ſuch as may be a pattern to all his ſervants This is implied in his ſending them <hi>to walk to and fro through the earth,</hi> and that <hi>they anſwered the Angel of the Lord, we have walked to and fro through the earth.</hi> 5. Chriſt hath perſect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all the affaires, and conditions, and wayes of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, for the good of his Church: this is repreſented by his Angels going forth to ſpie all things, and by their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him an account for information; not that he needs theſe helps, who knowes all things immediately by himſelf, but he expreſſeth it thus; partly to ſet out his glory to our capacity,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169977:29"/>that he is a Royal King, with a great traine, and many intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers and agents abroad, and partly to condeſcend to the weakneſſe of our faith, which would ſee meanes for effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that which he hath alſufficiency in himſelf to do. 6. It pleaſeth the Lord for the triall and exerciſe of his Churches faith and patience, and for making way to his bowels of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, to afflict his people, when other people are at eaſe, and to leave them furtheſt behinde to ſenſe in outward things, who have beſt right to be well beyond others; for <hi>the whole earth ſitteth ſtill and is at reſt</hi> while <hi>Judah</hi> is vexed. 7. As Chriſt perfectly knowes the condition of the world and of his people, ſo his infinite wiſdome is the only fit carver of all remedies, and improver of caſes, to his Churches advantage, this is inſinuate in that they make their report ſimply, without preſcription of a remedy, but leave that to him.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad diſpenſation, and let forth ſome effects of his mercy toward her, when all others were at eaſe: To which a good anſwer is returned. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſt do not alwayes appear in glorious acts of power for his people in trouble, to prove his remembering of them; yet it is a ground of comfort and token of good, to know that the Church and her afflictions have a room in Chriſts heart, and are matter of his interceſſion to the Father; therefore the ſcope of this viſion
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169977:29"/>is to aſſure them of Chriſts interceſſion for them, as the ground of many promiſes to be performed in due time. 2. Chriſt by vertue of the Covenant of Redemption paſt betwixt the Father and him, and the Covenant of grace made with ſinners in him, did exerciſe his Office of Mediator and Interceſſor for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, making the price to be paid forth-coming in all ages, even before his incarnation; for here at this time, he is interceding for the Church of the Jewes. 3. Chriſt the Interceſſor is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſee the Churches good, and hath perfect knowledge of her affaires, and what her caſe requires, which puts him to appear for her in every neceſſity, and that very affectionatly, as if himſelfe were concerned and engaged in her trouble, all this is here ſaid of this Interceſſor, for he looks on her as his charge, for which he muſt make account, as being <hi>the Angel,</hi> or, <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the Lord</hi> for that end: his information received in the former verſe ſhewes, that he is neither ignorant nor careleſſe of her caſe; his interceding upon that information unrequired, and <hi>anſwering</hi> it, as calling him to do his duty, ſhewes how mercifull and faithfull and High Prieſt he is, and his pleading <hi>how long &amp;c?</hi> doth not import any diſtruſt in him, or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling of his Father, but his deep reſentment of his Churches calamitie, and his cordiall affection to her and her welfare. 4. Theſe for whom Chriſt intercedes are not the periſhing world, but his own in the world, and his viſible Church for their ſake, that ſhe may be ſo dealt with as may moſt conduce for their bringing in and training up for heaven; for, here he prayes for <hi>Jeruſalem and the cities of Judah,</hi> as repreſenting the viſible Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church, and as being the viſible Church wherein the elect were brought forth to God. 5. Chriſt in his interceſſion will not quit any of his or his peoples rights, but will plead them to the full, and keep up his whole claime, however matters ſeem to go; for however they were now ſcarce one City, yet he pleads for <hi>Jeruſalem and the cities of Judah,</hi> for all the people; and is accordingly anſwered, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. for things are never deſperate, which are within his claime. 6. Albeit Chriſt doth intercede for his own that are not within the fold that they may be brought in, yet then have we clear ground to make uſe of, and apply the benefit of Chriſts interceſſion to our comfort, when we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the way of our duty; for no mention is made of them who returned not from captivity, but only of <hi>Jeruſalem and the cities of Judah.</hi> 7. Chriſts way of interceſſion teacheth his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169977:30"/>people to come through him to God in faith as to one compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to help them in all extremities; for he prayes to him as <hi>Lord of hoſtes,</hi> who could remove all impediments out of the way of his peoples happineſſe. 8. Such are fit for receiving the comfortable fruits of Chriſts interceſſion, as are humble, and made to ſtoop and expect them from free mercy; for Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes on no other termes, but that <hi>he will have mercy;</hi> which is extended to the miſerable, and ſuch as are ſenſible of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch. 9. Tender mercy, and bowels of compaſſion in God, is the carver out of what ſhall be the lot of his humble people; for Chriſt comprehends all they are to receive in its fountaine, which is <hi>mercy.</hi> 10. Such as Chriſt the Mediator taketh charge of he will not have them behinde with any for happineſſe; for, ſo much doth his complaining that mercy was not ſhewed to the Church, while as others were at eaſe, teach us. 11. Chriſt doth tenderly weigh the meaſure and continuance of the Churches trouble; ſo doth he here; <hi>Againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten yeares.</hi> 12. Albeit the Lord for a time let out diſpleaſure againſt his Church for ſinne, yet his ordinary way of diſpenſation in the world, and his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar favour to his Church, will allow her to expect a viciſſitude and change of her hard condition into a better, after his prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time for triall is over; for after the ſeventy years captivity Chriſt pleads, that <hi>indignation</hi> ſhould reſolve in <hi>mercy.</hi> 13. The ſad effects of a captivity may laſt long time after the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity is over, that ſo the fruites of ſinne may be well ſtudied, that a people ſo uſed may be ſtirred up more earneſtly to ſeek God, and that Chriſt may have much occaſion to let forth his bowels of affection, and his fathers through him; for here, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſeventy years are over, the Lord yet <hi>had not mercy on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to wit, in that meaſure of outward effects they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed before their captivity, and was promiſed to them after it. 14. Chriſt is ſuch an Interceſſor, as even when he takes moſt deſperate-like cauſes in hand, he will be heard, and muſt be ſatisfied in his deſires; for, <hi>the Lord anſwered the Angel that talked with me.</hi> 15. The anſwer which Chriſt the Interceſſor receives will be ſatisfactory and comfortable, it will be ſuch as he accounts good, and ſo ſhould we, and being good ſhould be comfortable, and will prove ſo in the end; for he is anſwered with <hi>good and comfortable words.</hi> 16. A Church may receive rich fruits of Chriſts interceſſion, although at firſt they be not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169977:30"/>nor get the reſt which they expect, to wit, when they are led to ſpiritual things inſtead of temporal which they want, and get promiſes renewed of what is in due time to be performed: for Chriſts anſwer here is <hi>good and comfortable words,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes concerning ſpiritual things, and their own enlargement, after publiſhed.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>This good anſwer is not kept up by Chriſt the Interceſſor, but the ſumme of it is preſently given to the Prophet to publiſh unto the Church for her comfort, it containeth ſeverall particulars; whereof the firſt is, a commiſſion to publiſh the Lords affection to his Church, to do her good, and his indignation and griefe (ſpeaking after the manner of men) for the injuries ſuſtained by her, no leſſe then any man hath for his married and beloved wife. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts fidelity and affection to his people for whom he intercedes, is ſuch, that he will not long keep up from them the fruits of his purchaſe and interceſſion in their need; this is repreſented to us in this, that a good anſwer and good newes being given, before (ſo to ſay) he read the packet, he poſts it away to the Church by the Prophet, <hi>So the Angel that communed with me ſaid, Crie thou, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Good newes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church are to be expected from heaven as the fruit of Chriſts interceſſion, and are to be read in the Word and meſſages put in the mouth of his commiſſion-ſervants from day to day: So here, theſe good newes are the anſwer which Chriſt received to his prayer, and are ſent from Heaven to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophet. 3. It is incumbent to theſe who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as Ambaſſadours betwixt Chriſt and his people, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his minde with ſuch zeal and alacrity, ſuch affection and confidence, as may in ſome meaſure repreſent his great love who ſent the meſſage, his delight to do them good, and his real pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to performe what he ſaith; for this cauſe is the Prophet here commanded, <hi>to cry</hi> this meſſage. 4. The Lords relation to his people is a marriage tie, which is not broken by every fault, nor caſt off in ſad diſpenſations: for, his <hi>being jealous for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169977:31"/>her,</hi> importeth, that ſhe was the wife ſtill, for all ſhe had done, or had come upon her. 5. Albeit the Lord will neither hold ſtroaks off his people when they need or deſerve them, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them till his time come; yet his marriage-affection doth reſent all their trouble and injuries done to them, ſo that they grieve not, nor are wronged, but his heart bleeds, as in due time will appear in effects; <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>jealous for Jeruſalem and Sion with a great jealouſie.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A ſecond branch of the anſwer given in commiſſion to the Prophet, holds forth Gods great diſpleaſure againſt the enemies of the Church for all their quiet condition, becauſe that when God intended to correct his people by their meanes, they had proven ſevere executioners. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it is an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh mark to live at eaſe in an uncertain world, eſpecially when the Church is in trouble; ſo Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt heathens, or men of heatheniſh diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and practiſes in afflicting the Church of God may be very great, and ready to break forth in due time, notwithſtanding their eaſie life and quiet eſtate, <hi>I am very ſore diſpleaſed with the heathen that are at eaſe.</hi> 2. The Lords hotteſt diſpleaſure againſt his own people will be found very eaſie when it is compared with his ſeverity againſt his enemies; therefore however the Jewes be called to conſider it in it ſelfe, as <hi>ſore diſpleaſure, v.</hi> 2. yet being thus compared with the lot of others: it is ſaid, <hi>I was but a little diſpleaſed.</hi> 3. Albeit none of the Churches enemies, and inſtruments of Gods chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, can tranſgreſſe the bounds of his purpoſe and permiſſion, to adde any thing to the Churches trouble, yet as they go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his revealed will and approbation, ſo they uſe to execute Gods purpoſe, with ſuch cruell mindes and ſo deſtructive inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as renders them highly guilty before God; thus, <hi>They helped forward the affliction,</hi> when God was <hi>but a little diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> they had more cruelty in their way then God determined to be executed, and they intended and aimed at the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Church, when God intended only to correct
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169977:31"/>and purge them. 4. As the cruell deſignes of the Churches enemies will faile them; ſo their ſeverity in executing the Lords controverſie, is a token of Gods ſore anger againſt them, and of their approaching ruine; for, the Church is now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in part, beyond their expectations and deſires, and this their way, ſpeaks God <hi>very ſore diſpleaſed,</hi> which will not long conceale.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>A third branch of this anſwer and meſſage, holds forth ſome promiſed effects of his declared love to his people, to wit, that the Lord, being now reconciled with them, the Temple ſhould be built: and their City and wall alſo in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time (ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the ſtretching out of a workmans line to ſquare his building by, when he works) and ſo in effect promiſeth to erect their publick worſhip, and Politick State. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord who ſpeaks comfortably of his love to the Church in her trouble, will in due time let forth reall and convincing proofes and fruits thereof; This promiſe comes in on the back of the former concerning his love to his people, and hatred againſt her afflicters, with a <hi>therefore,</hi> as minding to give a reall proof of what he ſaid. 2. As the Lords preſence with his people as a reconciled God, is a chief fruit of his love; ſo temporal calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will not hinder his manifeſting of his being reconciled, in his own due time; for after he had been angry with them, and had gone away, as to any outward manifeſtation of his preſence, he aſſureth them again, as a great proof of his love. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I am returned to Jeruſalem.</hi> 3. The Lords furniture and traine when he comes to dwell in his Church, are tender mercies of all ſorts, without which his Church could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, nor he dwell long with her; and which ſhall rejoyce over any other diſpenſation he may let out upon her, <hi>I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Jeruſalem with mercies,</hi> ſaith he. 4. The Lord may be reconciled with, and in the midſt of his people, loaden with mercy, when yet all things are but in the promiſes, going to bud forth in performance, <hi>I am returned,</hi> ſaith the Lord, when
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169977:32"/>yet neither the City nor houſe were built. 5. The ſetting up of Gods houſe and worſhip amongſt a ſinfull unworthy people, is a chief evidence of his preſence, and fruit of his tender mercy; <hi>My houſe ſhall be built in it,</hi> is the firſt fruit of his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with mercies.</hi> 6. Albeit the building of Gods houſe, and ſetting up his worſhip, be the Churches duty, the neglect whereof is her great ſinne; yet it is the Lord who only can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſet it up and hold it up, and the humble follower of his duty, may be encouraged by conſidering that what is their task, God is alſo engaged by promiſe to ſee it done, therefore what they were commanded to do by <hi>Haggai,</hi> here God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſee it done when they ſet about it, <hi>My houſe ſhall be built in it, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 7. Where Gods work goes firſt on as mens chief care, their own particulars will ſucceed the better, although they were to raiſe out of the very duſt and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of long deſolation; therefore it is promiſed in the ſecond place, <hi>and a line ſhall be ſtretched forth upon Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The laſt branch of this anſwer (for which the Prophet gets a new commiſſion) containes yet more effects of his love, that whereas now they were but a few and poor people, ſo that they behoved to bring people from the countrey to inhabit <hi>Jeruſalem, Neh.</hi> 11. The Lord promiſes that all their Cities ſhould not only be peopled, but ſhould overflow with men and proſperity, (as ſome ſhadow of the enlargement of Chriſts Kingdome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel) and that by all theſe diſpenſations he would comfort this people, and confirme them in that priviledge of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his choſen people, notwithſtanding their temporal rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord hath ſaid much for the comfort of his people, he hath ſtill yet more to ſay, to be as confidently avowed, as if he had made but promiſe of one thing; and his ſervants need much up-ſtirring to ſearch into the riches of Chriſt, and not to weary in bringing it forth unto his people: therefore after the former commiſſion and promiſes, <hi>Cry yet</hi> ſaith the Lord. 2. Though there be many things that ſeem to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169977:32"/>lie in the way of promiſes, ſuch as guilt, difficulties, length of time, &amp;c. which may make performance ſeem impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if not impoſſible: yet the faith both of Preachers and people ought to ſtep over theſe, and whatever appear to the contrary, the promiſe is to be publiſhed and believed; this is imported in the many <hi>yets</hi> in this commiſſion and promiſe; <hi>Cry yet,</hi> my cities ſhall <hi>yet</hi> ſpread, &amp;c. ſhewing that whatever be ſaid to the contrary theſe things ſhould be. 3. When God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with a people, all things that concernes them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Lords; in a ſpecial manner, to get protection and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from him; for now their cities are his: <hi>My Cities.</hi> 4. Though the Lords people reconciled with him, may lie low for a time, yet his bleſſing can exalt them beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>My cities through proſperity ſhall yet be ſpread abroad.</hi> 5. Though the Lords people ſeem oft-times to be ſtricken with incurable and grievous wounds, yet the Lord both can, and in due time will comfort them over all their ſorrowes, and make them forget their miſeries; <hi>And the Lord ſhall yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Zion.</hi> 6. The great comfort that ariſes to the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from all his gracious diſpenſations, is that by them they are confirmed in the priviledge of being his peculiar people, and ſtanding in his favour, which by ſad afflictions ſeemed to be annulled and made void: for their comfort is, that by theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations <hi>he ſhall yet chooſe Jeruſalem,</hi> or give a new proofe of it.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169977:33"/>the Gentiles, which lift up their horne over the land of Judah to ſcatter it.</p>

                  <p>In this ſecond viſion, that part of the former meſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods diſpleaſure againſt the Churches enemies, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and the removal of all obſtructions in the way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of promiſes is held forth; the ſumme whereof is, that as when God purpoſed to exerciſe and chaſten them, ſtrong and fierce enemies had ariſen from all quarters of the world, and had ſcattered the whole body of Gods people, both of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> (which enemies are repreſented to the Prophet, and under the type of <hi>hornes,</hi> alluding to the cuſtome of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who had iron hornes in their helmets for terrour, or to beaſts whom enemies reſemble in cruelty;) ſo albeit the Jewes could not reſiſt them, nor ſhake off the yoke till their trial was perfected; yet the Lord had other enemies and fitted inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ready in all quarters, to be terrible unto theſe oppreſſors, and caſt them out of their power, and to break and cruſh it, which alſo is repreſented to the Prophet under the type of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, or Hammer-men, able to break and cut off theſe hornes, and both theſe types are explained by the Lord unto him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When greateſt promiſes are given to the Church, her faith may have ſoreſt eſſayes, and greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions may appear in the way of performance, from potent, cruel and beaſtly enemies on all quarters, concurring together for her ruine; &amp; not only threatening, but who have actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed ſo much cruelty, as may put her in feare for the future; for, when all theſe promiſes are made; <hi>Then I lift up mine eyes, and behold, foure hornes, which have ſcattered Judah, Iſrael and Jeruſalem.</hi> 2. As difficulties invironing the Church would be ſeen by her, that ſhe may be ſtirred up to her dutie: ſo the beſt ſight of them, and expounding of their way is had from God, whereby ſhe will ſee them to be under an over-ruling Providence, and that God takes notice of every circumſtance of her trouble; therefore the Prophet is made to ſee theſe hornes: and albeit their trouble from enemies was a known thing, yet the Lord will diſcover it in viſion, and expound it himſelf upon the Prophets queſtion, to ſhew that God knew, and had an hand in what they did. 3. Albeit the Lord take notice of all the cruelties exerciſed upon his Church, yet in a ſpecial manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:169977:33"/>he reſents the enemies deſigne, to cut the face of a Church from off the earth; for, <hi>they ſcattered Judah, &amp;c.</hi> as beaſts toſſe what they get upon their hornes into the winde, and for this cauſe it is, that the ſcattering of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Temple ſtood, is conſidered by it ſelf, though it be a part of <hi>Judah.</hi> 4. Albeit the Lord do not alike ſoon deliver all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, yea, albeit theſe who were laſt afflicted be firſt deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the ſufferings of all are in his heart, and not forgotten in their trouble; and preſent ſufferers have the advantage of all the Churches former trouble, whoſe wounds do all bleed on every new ſtroak; therefore albeit <hi>Judah</hi> get the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of this viſion, as appears, <hi>v.</hi> 21. yet the Prophet is made to ſee, that the hornes have <hi>ſcattered Judah, Iſrael and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> not only becauſe ſome Iſraelites had cleaved unto <hi>Judah;</hi> ſince the renting of the ten tribes from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but to ſhew that <hi>Iſraels</hi> troubles were laid up in his heart, to be forth-coming for their good in due time, and that <hi>Judah</hi> had this advantage againſt her enemies, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſuffered by them alſo. 5. Such as have opened eyes may diſcern as much for the encouragement of the Church, as can be ſeen againſt her: that God is powerful to cruſh all her enemies, and hath as many effectual meanes for that end on all quarters, as they have power and confederates: for, the Prophet is made to ſee <hi>foure Carpenters,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>foure hornes.</hi> 6. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficulties and enemies may eaſily be ſeen; yet help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them can be ſhewed by God only; for whereas it is ſaid of the hornes that the Prophet <hi>ſaw</hi> them, it is ſaid of their help expreſly; <hi>The Lord ſhewed me foure Carpenters.</hi> 7. Chriſt the King, Prieſt and Prophet of his Church, is very God, equal with his Father; for here the Angel, who all this while had communed with, and informed the Prophet in viſion and who had interceded for the Church, is <hi>Jehovah; The Lord ſhewed me.</hi> 8. No ſucceſſe which enemies have had againſt the Church, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her trial and exerciſe will aſſure them againſt a day of vengeance, or make them ſtand before the fitted inſtruments thereof; for, however <hi>theſe hornes have ſcattered Judah, ſo that no man did lift up his head, yet theſe are come to fray them, and caſt out the hornes of the Gentiles:</hi> The inſtruments of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will eaſily affright them who had been the terrour of the world, and will caſt them out, not only from poſſeſſing the Churches inheritance which they had uſurped, but from their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169977:34"/>own kingdomes and power which they had employed ſo ill. 9. Whatever other wickedneſſe; perſecutors of the Church may be guilty of, or whatever quarrel the inſtruments of their ruine may have againſt them; yet the Lords great controverſie which fills their cup, and which the Church themſelves, and the world about ſhould look on as the cauſe of their ruine, is their oppoſition unto, and their oppreſſing of the people of God; therefore is it the third time ſet down in this viſion, that they <hi>lift up their horne over the land of Judah to ſcatter it.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Here is promiſed unto the Church, that however they were now a few people to inhabit the city or countrey, and deſtitute of cattel as well as men, yet they ſhould ſo increaſe, as that the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould not contain them, but they ſhould dwell without the precincts thereof, and ſpread themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the countrey and villages, hereby prefiguring the future en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Church, beyond what was under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. This is repreſented unto the Prophet under the type of Chriſt, as a man with a meaſuring line, declaring unto the Prophet his purpoſe to build and ſet bounds to his own Church, and who being attended by Angels, ſends one of them to the Prophet with this meſſage to be communicated unto the Church, for to encourage them to go on in the work, and to invite the ſcattered Jewes to come home and joyne with their brethren. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as would ſee the true caſe and condition of the Church, had need of elevated and ſpiritual mindes, enlightened by God; for, <hi>Zechariah lift up his eyes and looked,</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened of God in this viſion; and ſaw the Churches caſe far otherwiſe then the caſe of the city, looked on by a natural eye at that time, could promiſe. 2. Theſe who ſee <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Church well, will ſee Chriſt ſtill employed about her, and careful of her well-being, and that her proſperity is the great buſineſſe of heaven, about which Chriſt and Angels are buſie, and of this Chriſt would have his Church aſſured; for, here he looked <hi>again</hi> after the former viſion, wherein he had ſeen Chriſt, <hi>and behold, a man with a meaſuring line, &amp;c.</hi> to wit, Chriſt himſelf in humane ſhape, who is buſie meaſuring the city, <hi>going forth</hi> to it, and making to work; and another Angel, (one of many attending him) <hi>went out to meet him</hi> in this work: and command is given that the Church know this,

                     <hi>Run, ſpeak, &amp;c.</hi> that this man is Chriſt, appeareth, in that it is he who hath command of Angels, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. for he who ſpake to the Prophet, <hi>v.</hi> 2. is the <hi>Angel that talked with him, v.</hi> 3. 3. It is the duty of all the Lords people, and particularly his Commiſſion-ſervants, to be humbly and carefully diligent to ſearch out the Lords minde in his actings and Providences: and for that end, as to ſearch into his Word, ſo to preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuites unto himſelf; for here the Prophet, ſeeing Chriſt at work, deſires to be informed; <hi>Then ſaid I, Whither goeſt thou?</hi> 4. Chriſt hath the bounds of his Church at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and meaſuring, he hath abounding charter granted by the Father, which no oppoſition ſhall be able to retrinch; for he alone hath <hi>the meaſuring line,</hi> v. 1. He can deſigne the <hi>length and breadth of Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 2. and can irrevocably declare the enlargement thereof. <hi>v</hi> 4. 5. As the Lord can eaſily enlarge his Church from a ſmall beginning, ſo it is his purpoſe under the New Teſtament, not only to extend the pale of his Church further then to the Nation of the Jewes; but ſtill to enlarge and make his Kingdome come from Nation to Nation, till all <hi>Iſrael</hi> be ſaved, and the fulneſſe of the Gentiles come in, and the Kingdomes of the earth become the Kingdomes of the Lord, &amp;c. for, here in the letter, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (now ſmall) <hi>ſhall be inhabited as cowne; without walls, for the multitude of men and cattel therein:</hi> and by this type the enlargement of the Goſpel-Church is held forth, which we are ſtill commanded to pray for. 6. As the Lord may employ whom he pleaſeth, even young men, and make them fit and able for his work; ſo whoſoever are employed by him, ought to be nimble and active in going about his directions in their office, and to be abaſed in their own eyes before him who employeth them: for, here the Prophet is called <hi>this young man,</hi> either in reſpect of his age, or becauſe he ought to be nimble in his office as a boy, or in reſpect of his abaſing himſelf, and being nothing in his own eyes, when he ſaw Chriſt and the created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell.</p>

                  <p>Whereas the former promiſes of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> enlargement, as townes without walls ſeemed to import, that they ſhould not be in ſafety; the Lord prevents this, and promiſes that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection ſhould make them as ſafe, as if they were encompaſſed with a wall of fire, (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was, when the pillar of fire ſtood betwixt them and the Egyptians, <hi>Ex.</hi> 14. as <hi>Eliſha</hi> in <hi>Dothan,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.17. or as travellers in the wilderneſſe kept off lions and wilde beaſts, by building fires round about them;) and that they ſhould have the comfort of his glorious preſence, dwelling in the midſt of them, making them glorious, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them of protection, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. One promiſe of Chriſt, and proof of his love, will ſtill call for another to make that ſure, and ſo on till the Church get performance once for all; therefore, the former promiſe of enlargement calls for this new one of protection, and gets it. 2. When the Lord ſees it fit to exempt his people from trouble, he can in moſt unſafe times, and when they are weakeſt, ſafely protect them, by bridling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies by his ſecret hand, by making the Church finde favour in their eyes, or making their attempts as ineffectual, as if they would eſſay to go through a fire; and even when his Church taſtes of trouble, yet ſhe is not ſecluded from his protection, nor expoſed to the will of enemies, and what they do againſt her ſhall be as prejudicial to them, as if they had gone through a burning fire; <hi>I, ſaith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about,</hi> doth import all this. 3. As the Lords preſence with and amongſt a people is their greateſt glory, and makes them glorious; ſo it is a pledge of their protection, that he will ſecure his own habitation, and put a defence on his own glory, whatever they be; for, where he is <hi>a wall of fire,</hi> there he is <hi>the glory in the midſt of her,</hi> and therefore <hi>a wall.</hi>

                  <p>This doctrine concerning <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> enlargement and ſafety,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169977:36"/>is by Chriſt applied to ſeveral ſorts of perſons for uſe, in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold exhortation: 1. To the Jewes, who having in ſeventy yeares time forgotten their own countrey, many of them alſo being borne in captivity, and being taken up with the pleaſures of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and looking on all as deſperate in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, did voluntarily ſtay ſtill when the reſt came away; theſe are again and again exhorted with all ſpeed on all hazards, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and help to build the City and dwell in it, that ſo that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be conſpicuous til Chriſt ſhould come, who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Chureh, and that they might ſhare with the reſt in theſe promiſes. In this exhortation two reaſons are couched: 1. That their ſcattering into <hi>Babel,</hi> and into all other corners, (of which ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.11.) was a judgement, and therefore not to be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te under, eſpecially now when God in pity to them, was reſtoring them. 2. That being <hi>Zion,</hi> it was not ſeemly to ſee them in <hi>Babylon,</hi> when they might be at <hi>Jeruſalem. Doct.</hi> 1. It may encourage every one in their ſtation to put their hand to help forward Chriſts work, and to come and joyne in it, when they conſider that he is about it, in whoſe hand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will miſcarry, and Chriſts kindneſſe to his Church, may invite all to come and joyne with her; for, the ſcope and drift of the preceding viſion is declared to be the encouragement of the Jewes, to go on in the work, and an invitation of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to leave all and come unto them. 2. The worſt and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of conditions may in proceſſe of time, be ſate down under by unſenſible ſouls, with ſtupidity, and ſuch an outgate made of them, as they will be quitting hope of better; for, theſe people who could not think of going to <hi>Babel,</hi> have now ſetled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it, as their home, and need call upon call to come out of it; <hi>Ho, ho, flee, deliver thy ſelf.</hi> 3. It is an uſual ſin in men, through negligence, love of the world, prejudice at the way of God, and unwillingneſſe to embarque in difficulties, to neglect their own true good, and their duty for enlargement of the Kingdome of Chriſt: for theſe cauſes it was that the Jewes need ſo many calls to leave <hi>Babylon,</hi> and come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to joyne in the work of God, and enjoy the meanes of ſalvation. 4. Albeit the commands of God ſeem many times unjuſt to our ſenſe, and obedience thereunto very prejudicial, yet upon better information, we will finde that our advantage lies in ſpeedy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon any hazard; therefore the call to theſe lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring Jewes, is not only to come forth, but <hi>to flee and deliver
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169977:36"/>thy ſelfe,</hi> or, <hi>make an eſcape</hi> on any termes, as out of a great hazard, albeit they thought it their beſt to abide there. 5. As the Lord, in ſhewing mercy to his people, calls to minde their formes afflictions, that he may be ſo much the more kinde; ſo however the Lord may make the place of his peoples captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eaſie to them, yet it is a judgement-like diſpoſition, when a people chooſes that for their reſt, and outgate, which God hath caſt them in, in wrath, and as a puniſhment for ſin, however it may ſeem to promiſe eaſe; therefore the Lord himſelf mindes their ſcattering when he is to ſhew mercie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and mindes them of their ſcattering as a fruit of his wrath, that they ſhould not think to dwell ſtill there; <hi>Ho, ho, come forth, for I have ſpread you abroad as the foure windes of the heaven, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 6. The Churches ſerious conſidering of her Profeſſion, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and dignity, may diſcover unto her, how unbeſeeming many of her practices are, how little ſhe adornes her profeſſion, or walks worthy of her high calling: therefore doth he name her <hi>Zion,</hi> that it might ſhame her from <hi>dwelling with the daughter of Babylon.</hi> 7. Unneceſſary and voluntary converſing with idolaters, is an evil full of hazard to the people of God, conſidering how much they loſe by neglecting better company, what danger there is of infection by them, and of participating with them in their judgements; therefore is <hi>Zion to deliver her ſelfe, who dwelleth with the daughter of Babylon.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A third reaſon is expreſly ſubjoyned to the exhortation, to wit, that after Chriſt had viſited and afflicted his own people; and eſpecially after he hath begun to make his glory ſhine in reſtoring them, he is alſo ſent by his Father to puniſh their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and reſtrain them from impeding the perfecting of the Churches glory, by doing whereof he would make known his affection to the Church, and his reſentment of her afflictions; and therefore it was not ſafe for them to ſtay in <hi>Babel,</hi> nor fit to ſtick at impediments. So that by <hi>the glory</hi> here we are to

Chriſt is the fit and faithful Interpreter of his Fathers will, the revealer of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and he who ſeeth it executed; for here he tells what <hi>the Lord of hoſtes ſaith,</hi> and is <hi>ſent</hi> to ſee the Fathers will done. 2. The Church will finde it to be a very unſafe courſe for her to joyne and comply with her enemies, even although theſe who do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſeem to expoſe themſelves to great hazard; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Jewes in <hi>Judea</hi> were environed with enemies, and theſe in <hi>Babylon</hi> ſeemed ſecure, yet wrath was to come there, and therefore it was their beſt to flee. 3. The Church of God is the ſociety, where he ſets forth his glory more then among all the world beſide, and in doing good to whom he delights to be glorified: and fetches arguments ſo to do from his own glory, when there is no cauſe in her: therefore ſhe is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the glory.</hi> 4. As it is no mark of the true Church to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from afflictions; and as ſhe loſeth none of her ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in his eyes, by any afflictions: ſo the Churches afflictions are fore-runners of judgement on the world, and her enemies; and when he begins to let forth his glory in her, after a ſtorme, he will ſee that no enemies ſhall impede him in carrying it on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As Gods ſeverity againſt his people takes not away his ſympathie with them in their afflictions; ſo his ſympathy makes the Churches trouble go very near his heart, which he will in due time prove upon the inſtruments thereof; for this is the cauſe of his going unto the nations, <hi>they ſpoiled you;</hi> and the reaſon is brought from his ſympathie: for, <hi>he that toucheth you, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the apple of mine eye</hi> a touch of them on any part, is to his ſympathie, a touch of the apple of his eye, which is a moſt tender part.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>This reaſon is further enlarged and cleared from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Chriſts taking order with their enemies, to wit, that though they be great in power; and have none to oppoſe them: yet if he do but ſhake his hand and give the ſigne, or toſſe them a little their very ſervants whom they formerly conquered and kept in ſlavery, ſhall undo and lord it over them, and poſſeſſe their goods, wherein the Jewes were actors in part, both in the dayes of <hi>Eſther,</hi> and at home when they brought their enemies about, who had concurred in afflicting them, into ſubjection. The effect of all which ſhall be a confirmation of them by this new experiment, that Chriſt is ſent of the Father to declare and execute theſe promiſes, as Protector of his Church. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit when we hear Gods Word ſpeaking for the Church, or againſt her enemies, we are ready to queſtion: <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> yet Omnipotency will eaſily finde a way to fulfil promiſes or threatenings, and can take the moſt contemptible, and ſucceſſefully employ them againſt moſt potent Conquerours, who have left none (as they think) in the world, to take order with them: for, <hi>behold, I will ſhake mine hand upon them, and they ſhall be a ſpoile to their ſervants:</hi> and to confirm this, he declareth himſelf to be <hi>the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 2. It is the Lords way, not only to bring down oppreſſing enemies, but ſo to do it, as may poure moſt ignominie upon them, and let all the world ſee their vanity and folly, who placed their ſecurity in any thing beſide God: for, <hi>they ſhall be a ſpoile to thy ſervants.</hi> 3. As it is not enough to have a braine notional knowledge of God, and what he hath revealed, unleſſe it be experimentally engraven upon the heart: ſo even the people of God may have their own queſtionings, concerning Gods care of them, and concerning what he hath ſaid in his Word, till by performance and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental proofs he put it out of all controverſie, which in due time he will do; for, when this is wrought, then they begin to know as they ought, and by this experiment he makes them <hi>certain, and ye ſhall know.</hi> 4. As every diſpenſation of God ought to inſtruct and fixe leſſons in our heart: ſo a ſpecial leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be read and learned by the Church, is Gods good will in employing his Son for their good, and Chriſts being on foot to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169977:38"/>procure good tidings to her, and let her ſee them really perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he being imployed by the omnipotent God for that effect; <hi>And ye ſhall know that the Lord of hoſtes hath ſent me.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſecond exhortation directed to the Jewes that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from captivity (which may ſerve alſo as an argument to theſe in <hi>Babel</hi> to come and partake of their promiſed happineſſe) is, that however they were in a low condition, yet they ſhould rejoyce and expreſſe their joy by ſinging. This he preſſeth from three grounds, whereof the firſt is, that Chriſt would come and take up his habitation in the midſt of them, not only typically or in legall ſhadowes, or by his grace and Spirit only, but that in the fulneſſe of time he would alſo come in perſon, and become man and dwell among them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No difficulty or ſtraite can take away from the Church the true cauſe of her joy, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her for not rejoycing in it; for when the Jewes are now a contemptible handfull, deſerted by their brethren, vexed by their enemies, and ſome of themſelves conſpiring with them, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.17, 18. and 13.4. yet ſhe is called to this duty; <hi>Sing and rejoyce, O daughter of Zion.</hi> 2. The Lords own preſence in and with his people, is his choice and matchleſſe gift, which he is willing to give before any other thing, and which as he will not diſdain to beſtow in his peoples loweſt condition; So it is a gift that ſhould occaſion much joy and refreſhment to them; for when they want many accommodations, the Ark and the cloud, and the company of their brethren, yet this is his great gift wherein they ſhould rejoyce; <hi>Sing and rejoyce, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and will dwell in the midſt of thee.</hi> 3. As the Lords preſence with his own choſen people is perpetual, and will bring intimate familiarity and love; ſo himſelfe will be at all the paines to make up this union, he will not, by ſinne putting him (as it were) away for a time, be provoked to ſtay away, and will have this communion ſtill upon the growing hand till they come to full fruition; for he will dwell conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that familiarly <hi>in the midſt of thee,</hi> and for this end <hi>I come,</hi> ſaith he, or am at the paines, I will not be kept away from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169977:38"/>coming again; and though they had his preſence in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure before, yet it is ſtill <hi>I come.</hi> 4. It is the great ground of the Churches encouragement, and the fountaine of all other mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of God, that the Sonne of God became man, that her Redeemer is God, that he came and dwelt in our nature, and was like us in all things without ſin; and that we may tryſt with God in the man Chriſt, and know our tender-hearted ſurety to be alſo God over all bleſſed for ever, and able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; this incarnation of Chriſt is it which this promiſe ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately points at as the ground of their joy, <hi>Sing, for I come, and I will dwell in the midſt of thee, ſaith Jehovah.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon of the exhortation, is, becauſe many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall joyne to the Lord and become one Church with them when he is incarnate, by which they ſhould yet further be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that Chriſt is ſent of the Father to be the Mediatour and Redeemer of his Church. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lord withholds from his people in following their duty, it is becauſe he purpoſeth richly to make it up another way; for if the Jewes were diſcouraged in building the Temple by their brethrens ſtaying behinde, here is a promiſe of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to make that up, <hi>And many Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord in that day.</hi> 2. It is the matter of great joy, that by the incarnation of Chriſt, the partition-wall betwixt Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile is caſt down, that all Nations without any difference, or diſtinction, have acceſſe, and do come to him, and that he makes many to be willing in the day of his power; for this is a new cauſe of their ſong, <hi>Many Nations ſhall be joyned to the Lord.</hi> 3. It doth contribute to ſet out the glory of Chriſts Kingdome under the Goſpel, that not only he hath elect and converted members of all Nations, without diſtinction: but that he brings whole Nations in viſible Covenant with him, and maketh a whole Nation to become a National viſible Church: for ſo is here propheſied of theſe dayes, <hi>Many Nations</hi> (and not ſome of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only) <hi>ſhall be joyned to the Lord,</hi> at leaſt by viſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169977:39"/>
                     <hi>in that day.</hi> 4. Moſt glorious promiſes may be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their performance, by carnall hearts, and not prove ſo comfortable as indeed they are; for the converſion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, is promiſed here as the matter of the Jewes joy, and yet it proved a ſtumbling block to the body of the Nation when it was performed, and will do till the converſion of the Gentiles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to jealouſie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. 5. A people do then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed come unto God, when beſide their being viſibly in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, they ſeek alſo union with him through ſaith in his Sonne, and do give themſelves up to his obedience, and that they may become his; which the ſenſible and humble ſoul ought to look upon, not only as their duty, but as Gods promiſe; ſo much doth this Prophecie ultimately point at, <hi>They ſhall be joyned to the Lord, and ſhall be my people.</hi> 6. As the Lords preſence is that which makes the ſociety of Saints comfortable, were they increaſing never ſo faſt; ſo the more the Church encreaſeth, he will let out the more of his preſence with her; for in that day of this acceſſion it is added againe, <hi>And I will dwell in the midſt of thee.</hi> Much converſion proves him to be preſent, will draw forth more of his preſence, and that will be all the converts joy. 7. As the converſion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to the Church, and removing all obſtructions out of their way, is a part of the Meſſiahs errand to the world; ſo alſo much converſion is an ample teſtimony to Chriſt, that he is the appointed Mediator ſent of the Father, that he hath alluring beauty under ſeeming deformity, invincible power and vertue managed by apparent weakneſſe, and that he hath received gifts for men, even for rebells that he may dwell among them; therefore by this work alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt know that the Lord of hoſtes hath ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </q>
                  <p>The third reaſon of the exhortation, ſpeaks more nearly to the preſent caſe of the Jewes, for whereas they might, upon the former promiſe concerning the Gentiles, look upon themſelves as rejected, eſpecially having neither the face of a Nation nor Temple, ſince they were rejected at the Babyloniſh captivity;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169977:39"/>therefore the Lord promiſeth that he will gather them from their diſperſions, and ſet them as his peculiar heritage in their own land, and that he will give new documents of their election to be his people, though it ſeemed now to be interrupted; that ſo they might be a peculiar habitation for him till he ſhould come in the fleſh, if not alſo pointing at their future converſion and reſtitution: ſeeing he ſpeaks of them as an inheritance. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lords Covenant entered in with a people may meet with many interruptions, in the viſible effects of it, without a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the bond and tie: ſo in particular, his relation to the Nation of the Jewes is ſuch as no temporal rejection can utterly make void; for here notwithſtanding all that hath come upon them, they keep their titles, and their election ſtands, and doth yet to this day, as is expounded to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28, 29. 2. The Lords people may expect to be no loſers by all their troubles, when God comes to repaire and make them up; for <hi>Judah</hi> after their captivity, gets <hi>the holy land,</hi> ſo called, not only becauſe the holy Lord dwelt there, in a peculiar way of preſence, and becauſe it was the habitation aſſigned to his people conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to him, and ſo an holy Nation; but becauſe it was a type of Heaven. 3. The Lords Church is his peculiar portion, which he ſeparates for himſelfe from the world, to deal with them ſingularly; <hi>The Lord ſhall inherit Judah his portion,</hi> he will take them for his heritage and portion, and uſe them ſo. 4. The Lords free choice and election of his people is of ſuch conſequence to them, and may meet with ſo many aſſaults and diſpenſations ſeeming to brangle it, that there is need of frequent confirmations and tokens for good, to eſtabliſh them in the faith of it: for this cauſe is this promiſe, <hi>And ſhall chooſe Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem again.</hi>

                  <p>The third exhortation is directed to all oppoſers of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whether misbelievers among the Jewes, who might be reaſoning againſt this doctrine, or enemies, who might boaſt to make them prove vaine; theſe are compeſced, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſilence, in their doublings and brags, ſeeing God was begun to appear out of Heaven for his people, as one not unmindfull
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169977:40"/>of his promiſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The promiſes of God may oft-times be little heard in the Church for her comfort, by reaſon of the tumult of fightings within, and of feares and oppoſition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for ſo is here imported. 2. A right conſidering how much frailty appeares in our diſtruſting, how weak all oppoſition is, and how ſtrong the Lord is, and how far wronged he is in his glory, by misbelieving his promiſes, may ſilence, and crie down our unbeliefe and compeſce enemies fury; for the Lord here ſo teaches, <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh before the Lord,</hi> the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ſuch a ſilence, as when a Maſter comes in among ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, or when a Prince appears. 3. Albeit Gods preſence in Heaven, and among his people, might ſilence unbelief, and terrifie oppoſers, conſidering that he is there, though he appear not, and that he will in due time appear; yet it may much more ſhew the folly of theſe wayes, when God hath appeared and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to work; for, his appearing once ſhould confirme faith, and aſſure his people of a compleat iſſue; and put enemies out of all hope of gaining their point, yea and aſſure them that their begun diſappointment and ruine is a pledge of more, whatever ſtrength or power they have; this may ſilence all fleſh before God, <hi>For he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>For our right taking up of this viſion, we are to conſider that as heretofore the Lord hath diſcovered unto the Church how he would remove great outward difficulties and oppoſition in the way of the Temple-building; ſo here they are lifted up to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of higher and ſtronger enemies, even Satan, who not only ſtirres up enemies to the work, but will take occaſion of their ſinne, for which they had ſmarted, to plead againſt them and the work in their hand, unleſſe Chriſt interpoſed. And as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the encouragements were given generally to all, ſo here particularly to <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High Prieſt; partly becauſe he was a chief man in building the Temple, and therefore as he would be much ſet on by Satan, ſo his confirmation and ſuſtaining was needfull, that he might encourage all others; partly, as being a Prieſt and repreſenting all the inferior Prieſts, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 8. the contemptibleneſſe of whoſe Office at that time, was a great diſcouragement to themſelves and the people, and therefore new promiſes are made of adorning the Prieſtly Office; till Chriſt the ſubſtance of that type ſhould come: together with an inſtructing of them to do their office better, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reward to the faithfull diſcharger of his truſt; and partly, as in his office ſtanding before the Lord in name of the whole people, and therefore gets promiſes made to him common with them: This being taken alongſt will make all the purpoſe clearer. So in this verſe we have repreſented unto the Prophet, the impediment lying in the way of the work and of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, to wit, that while <hi>Joſhua</hi> is imployed in his Office, for himſelfe and the people, before the Angell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Chriſt whoſe type and Miniſter he was; Satan, the Churches ſpeciall enemy, does what he can againſt him, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing his accuſation to hinder his acceptance, and plead him not worthy to do ſuch a work, and ſo ſets him to ſtand there as a delinquent before his Judge. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lords people going on in his work, will ſee difficulty ariſing after difficulty
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169977:41"/>to obſtruct their way; ſo is there in Chriſt ſufficiency of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, againſt all of them; for ſo much doth the ſcope of this viſion teach; after all the difficulties repreſented in the former viſions, here is a new difficulty, and Chriſt alſo anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. 2. The deepeſt and ſubtileſt plots of all oppoſers of the Church are moſt clearly known to Chriſt, who will either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cruſh them, or make them known to his Church, that ſhe may make her uſe of them; for <hi>He ſhewed me Joſhua, &amp;c.</hi> as a caſe not unknown to him. 3. It is the duty of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, eſpecially in hard times, to be much with God, and found in their duty whatever may come; to make much uſe of Chriſt for coming ſpeed at Gods hand; to ſet themſelves alwayes in their duty, as in his ſight, and to ſtudy to be approven of him: All which is imported in his poſture, he was <hi>ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord,</hi> who is the ſame with <hi>Jehovah, v.</hi> 2. to wit, Chriſt called an <hi>Angel,</hi> not in regard of his nature (for he took not upon him the nature of Angels,) but in regard of his office, being ſent of the Father, (as the word ſignifies) for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and ſalvation of his people 4. Such as ſee through all the oppoſition made unto the Church, and would have the right uſe of any oppoſition they ſee, would look higher then any viſible enemy, even to ſpiritual wickedneſſe in high places acting in them, who can be oppoſed only by ſpiritual weapons, and to Satan getting much advantage by their own ſinnes provoking God againſt them; for, ſo is revealed to the Prophet, <hi>Satan</hi> chief <hi>to reſiſt him.</hi> 5. Satan is a great enemy, as to every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoul in particular, ſo eſpecially to the reſtoring and building of the Church, and to ſuch as are eminently inſtrumental there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to a Miniſtery, that ſo they may be diſcouraged and made uſeleſſe; for, <hi>he reſiſts Joſhua the High Prieſt,</hi> who was eminent in building the Temple, and repreſented all the Prieſts and people. 6. Satan hath great advantage of the Lords people, by reaſon of his ſubtilty and power, and eſpecially by reaſon of their guilt, if Chriſt did not interpoſe; for, he is <hi>ſtanding at his right hand</hi> to reſiſt him, which forme of ſpeech imports not only ability to hinder his enterpriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

As the Lords people may meet with ſaddeſt aſſaults from Satan in their approaches

                  <p>In the next place is repreſented unto the Prophet, Chriſt who is the Lord, taking the defence of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and by his interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (acting as the Angel of the Lord) pleading, that Satan may be rebuked, confounded and reſtrained in his malicious and cruel deſigne to deſtroy them whom God had choſen, and them who having been almoſt conſumed in trouble, were mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly pluckt out and preſerved from total ruine. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt in his office of mediation and interceſſion, is the ſtrong refuge of the Church againſt Satan, who is ſufficient to oppoſe all his machinations, being himſelfe God equal with the Father, zealous for, and affectionate to his people and their weal; and the Father being engaged to help him and his, by vertue of the Covenant; for, <hi>The Lord ſaid to Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, even the Lord rebuke thee.</hi> Where <hi>Jehovah</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth for <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who hath ground to call to <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to appear alſo, and who teſtifies his zeal by doubling his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. 2. Albeit the ground of Satans accuſation of the Lords people before God, and in their own conſciences may be true and juſt: yet his inſatiable and cruel malice in proſecuting that controverſie to their deſtruction, and caſting out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is ſo far from being Chriſts allowance, that it is hateful unto him, and will be effectually ſuppreſſed by him; This is imported in his interceſſion; <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> or reſtrain thy malice, and make void thy intention. 3. The Lords ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of, and free love toward his people, is that whereby they are allowed to anſwer Satans tentations, which otherwiſe might
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169977:42"/>be heavy upon them; and where the Lord hath choſen and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do good unto a people, he will alſo have a care of their Miniſters for their ſake. This we are taught from Chriſts firſt reaſon of interceſſion: <hi>The Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem, rebuke thee.</hi> God having choſen them, Satans bill (how true ſoever) could not be heard to deſtroy them, or to reject <hi>Joſhua</hi> their Miniſter. 4. Though the people of God, may be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to painful and hard trouble, and may be kept in it till it come to ſome extremity that they may be purged, yet ſhall they certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reſcued and brought out again: for ſo was it with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and this remnant, <hi>a brand pluckt out of the fire;</hi> a ſtick halſe burnt, and yet thought worth the pulling out. 5. As the former afflictions of the Lords people do ſo endear them to Chriſts heart, that he will not hear Satans accuſations; ſo his eminent appearing for them in trouble, is a pledge that he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, but perfect his work notwithſtanding Satans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations: for, this is the force of the ſecond reaſon of Chriſts interceſſion, <hi>Is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire?</hi> as if he ſaid, ſhould my anger ſmoke yet againſt my people who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready almoſt conſumed by it, and whereof they yet bear the marks? ſhould I not make an end of pleading with fraile fleſh? and ſhall I prove ſo fooliſh a builder, as when I have appeared in bringing them out of conſuming trouble, giving them a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to eſcape; I ſhould again forſake them, and let all my paines be in vain.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt having defended <hi>Joſhua</hi> againſt Satans oppoſition, doth further repreſent to the Prophet, his taking away the ground of Satans accuſation; there being many ſins both of his own, and of the Prieſts and people for whom he interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wherewith they were polluted, as a man with filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169977:42"/>and whereof the badges were the baſe and low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both of Prieſts and people at that time; Chriſt doth take away the ſin by pardon, and with it the tokens of anger, and adornes him with his righteouſneſſe and with holineſſe in the fight of God, ſignified by the taking away of filthy garments, and putting on new raiment, and this is done by theſe who ſtood before Chriſt, that is, by his own appointed means and inſtruments, or by the Miniſtery who are employed by Chriſt in this work, as Angels were his Attendants in this viſion. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As ſin in it ſelf doth pollute and make vile, ſo where the pollution thereof in it ſelf and before God is not laid to heart, God is provoked to let it appear in viſible evidences, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſinner vile and contemptible; for, ſo is imported in that <hi>Joſhua was clothed with filthy garments.</hi> 2 As the ſenſe of ſin ought not to drive away the ſenſible ſinner from Chriſt, or from duty; ſo Chriſt will not caſt them from his preſence or care, till he help them againſt that which troubles them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, <hi>Joſhua</hi> in all this <hi>ſtood before the Angel.</hi> 3. As God requires, that his people for whom he appears, and eſpecially inſtruments eminently employed, be holy and reconciled with him, that ſo Satans mouth may be ſtopped, the work may proſper in their hands, and God may bleſſe them, and take away the tokens of his anger: ſo the only way for attaining this, is by a free pardon of ſin, and the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and by his vertue put forth for their ſanctification: for, this cloſeth the plea, when <hi>the filthy garments are taken from him,</hi> and when Chriſt <hi>cauſeth his iniquity to paſſe from him,</hi> and <hi>clotheth him with change of raiment,</hi> or new garments in place of the old. 4. As it is Chriſts office, and a peculiar fruit of his mercy, to pardon, juſtifie and ſanctifie his people; ſo hath he ſufficient meanes and wayes to apply this to his people, (eſpecially by his Meſſengers, to whom he gives the Miniſtery of reconciliation,) and to take away the tokens of his anger for ſin; for, while Chriſt <hi>ſpake to theſe that ſtood before him,</hi> to do this, it doth not import that Angels are employed about this work, though they take pleaſure in the proſpering of the Church, but that the Lord hath employed in this work a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery (repreſented by theſe Attendants,) who carry theſe glad tydings, and inſtrumentally do retain and looſe ſins, in whoſe mouth, ſpeaking from the Word, we are to finde Chriſts minde to the ſenſible ſoul, and whoſe voice they are commanded to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. and that ſin being pardoned, Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169977:43"/>enough to take away any bitter fruit of ſin, even Angels themſelves being willing to miniſter for their good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. 5. Whoever be the inſtruments employed, yet Chriſt is the chiefactor in the Churches reconciliation and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, who is to be eyed in what we enjoy, and who muſt ſpeak the Word to the heart, before we can be fully comforted; this is imported not only in that <hi>he ſpake to theſe that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him:</hi> but in that himſelf ſaith the Word, and expounds, and confirmes that action, <hi>Unto him he ſaid, Behold, I have cauſed thine iniquity to paſſe from thee, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt having promiſed remiſſion of ſin and ſanctification, common to the Prieſts and people, here is further repreſented the reſtoring of the Prieſtly dignity, the baſeneſſe whereof was a great diſcouragement to that people in their work: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in viſion ſeeing what was done, interpoſes that what was wanting of the Prieſtly dignity might be ſupplied, which is granted, and a promiſe is made of fitting <hi>Joſhua</hi> with ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and abilities as were ſuitable for his Prieſtly office, ſignified by the Prieſtly mitre and garments put upon him; Chriſt ſtanding by to ratifie the act, and aſſiſt his ſervants. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt takes pleaſure to have his gracious purpoſes carried on by the interceſſion and prayers of his people, who ought to ſtir up themſelves to take hold of the opportunity of a time of love, to repreſent ſuch things to Chriſt, as grieves and are a burden to them; for, the want of the former dignity of the Prieſthood being an affliction of that time, and the Prophet ſeeing Chriſt at work to do good to that people, interpoſeth for this, <hi>And I ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> and gets a good anſwer: the prayer put in his heart, being as a pledge that Chriſt would do the thing. 2. As the true grace of God, and reconciliation with him is an excellent qualification for any vocation to which the Lord calls a man, eſpecially for, the holy Miniſtery; ſo theſe who are called to that charge, do ſtand in need of a peculiar diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

As Chriſt will have a peculiar care to keep up a Miniſtery in his Church, and to furniſh them with the gifts of his Spirit; ſo Chriſt being reconciled with and about to do good unto a land, his Miniſters may expect peculiar diſpenſations of his Spirit, and to be kindly dealt with for that end; for ſo are we taught by <hi>ſetting of a faire mitre upon his head, and clothing him with garments,</hi> albeit now theſe ornaments were all loſt; yet the type ſheweth, that when the Lord is taking away the ſins of the people, the Prieſthood and Miniſtery ſhould not faile, and that in ſuch a time it ſhould be well with them. 4 Chriſt is the Church and his ſervants faſt friend, who will not ſee their affaires neglected, nor his purpoſes of good concerning them fruſtrated, and doth undertake to aſſiſt and maintaine them in their duty, and up-holding them againſt all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that his employing them, and doing for them, may raiſe unto them; for while they are clothing <hi>Joſhua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Faithful Miniſters are both to take heed to themſelves and their flocks, and to joyne faithful walking as religious men with fidelity in their publick charge, that their converſation may commend the duties of their function, and their own experience may help them to be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, zealous, faithful and lively in their publick truſt; for, both are joyned here in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> leſſon; <hi>If thou wite walk in my wayes,</hi> as all <hi>Iſrael</hi> are bound to do, <hi>and if thou wilt keep my charge,</hi> which belongs to the Prieſts office. 4.

The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Gods houſe have not only the Miniſtery of holy things, as Word and Sacraments committed to their charge, but alſo the power of Eccleſiaſtical Government, to take order with ſcandalous offences within the familie; both theſe are here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Prieſts; <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo judge my houſe, and ſhalt alſo keep my Courts;</hi> and this promiſe of government is according to the law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9, 12. and warrantable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.11. wherein no ſhadow of a type appears: for the government and kingly power of Chriſt was held forth in (at leaſt) ſome of their Kings, and not in the Prieſtly office. 7.

                  <p>In the ſecond part of the chapter, <hi>Joſhua</hi> is led up to ſee the Author and Purchaſer of all theſe benefits promiſed to him, and what is the ſubſtance and thing ſignified by his office, and the Temple which he was building, and to encourage him and ſtir up all to build the Temple, and to make much of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood he leads them to Chriſt the true Temple, in whom incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, dwells the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, who is the builder of his Church, and ground-ſtone of the building, and the true Prieſt who by his ſacrifice ſanctifies all believers.</p>
                  <p>In this verſe, <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the inferiour Prieſts are called to give attention, as being wondered at for their bold enterpriſes, and as being alſo in their office and way of life, types of Chriſt: and a promiſe is made to them that Chriſt ſhould come in the fleſh, as a contemptible branch of <hi>Jeſſe</hi>'s dry root, who in his eſtate of humiliation ſhould perfect the truth of the Prieſthood,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169977:45"/>as his Fathers obedient ſervant. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and kernel of all the Churches encouragements, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer of them, and in whom is ſupplied all that is found want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in other meanes of comfort; he is the reſtorer of his Church, the abſolver of his people, the ſubſtance of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the Upholder of the Miniſtery and true worſhip: therefore is the promiſe concerning him ſubjoyned, to make up all the reſt by. 2. There is need of ſpecial up-ſtirring and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, for the taking up of Chriſt, and the comforts allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, conſidering our carnal diſpoſitions, and how little may be diſcerned in Chriſt by them, till we get new ſenſes, and how the noiſe of diſcouragements and tentations may keep out the ſound of comfort; <hi>Hear now,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 3. Chriſt is the ſubſtance of all the ceremonies of the law, and of higher and lower offices in the Temple, who compleatly anſwers and fulfils, that whereof they were a ſhadow: in him alone is to be found in reality all that they prefigured: therefore <hi>Joſhua the High Prieſt, and his fellowes that ſit before him,</hi> are all called to <hi>hear,</hi> Chriſt being the ſubſtance of all their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, not only employed in the Churches eminent affaires as the High Prieſt was, but one who condeſcends to meaneſt employments about her, and the naile upon whom the meaneſt veſſel hangs. 4. As the Lords ſervants muſt not conſult with fleſh and blood, but undertake ſervices to which God calls them, though they ſhould be admired as monſters in ſo doing; ſo it is the ſpecial encouragement of ſuch, that they have Chriſt to look to, to whom they have relation in that work, and to whom the promiſe is made, and who will have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of doing that wherein they are inſtruments. Thus may we joyne a twofold interpretation of theſe words, <hi>They are men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at,</hi> to wit, admired in being chief in undertaking the work of the Temple: and that for their encouragement they were to look on themſelves, as types of Chriſt, who indeed carried on the work of that Temple, and who would build his own Church, and therefore they behoved to continue and the work go on, not only becauſe Chriſt had chief hand in it, but that the type might reſemble the thing typified. 5. It is the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-character of the true Meſſiah, that according to the fleſh he is to ſpring out of obſcure and contemptible beginnings, and to execute his offices, (eſpecially his Prieſthood,) and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the work of Redemption in the forme of a ſervant, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Chriſt the Mediatour is not only a part of the ſpiritual building, making up one Chriſt myſtical with all his members, and the eminent and moſt excellent part of it: but the very foundation of his Churches being, upon whom all the Church, and every particular member thereof is and muſt be built, and without whom they cannot ſubſiſt; for, he is <hi>the ſtone laid before Joſhua.</hi> 2. As Chriſt in his office of Mediation, is a meanes of the Fathers appointment, by him to derive happineſſe to the Church, and eſtabliſh her in it; ſo whoever deſpiſe and reject him, yet the Father will have him
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169977:46"/>high and eminent in that building; for, <hi>I have laid</hi> the ſtone <hi>before Joſhua,</hi> ſaith the Lord; See, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.42. 3. As Chriſt hath all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for ſeeing to the condition, and finding out the way of happineſſe for his people, in every caſe and exigent; ſignified by <hi>ſeven eyes</hi> (which is a number of perfection) engraven <hi>on</hi> that <hi>one ſtone;</hi> and as the vigilant Providence of God is alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon Chriſt as Mediatour, and for his ſake upon the welfare of his Church and Kingdome, as being his chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſignified alſo by <hi>ſeven eyes over</hi> that <hi>one ſtone:</hi> ſo alſo is Chriſt as Mediatour, God-man, revealing the Father in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and as the ſupport and upholder of his Church, ſo glorious and excellent as may draw all to admire him, and to fix their expectation on him, as the only choice and reſuge of loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and will do ſo to all the elect: which is alſo ſignified by <hi>ſeven</hi> (or, <hi>many</hi>) <hi>eyes</hi> fixed <hi>on</hi> that <hi>one ſtone,</hi> admiring him, and having all their expectation from him. 4. The beauty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and furniture of Chriſt the Mediatour, is divine and rare, and he is the ornament, glory and ſtore-houſe of all the ſpiritual building, being as God the brightneſſe of his Fathers glory, and the expreſſe image of his perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity alſo being adorned with the gifts of the Spirit without meaſure for his calling, and with all divine perſections in ſo far as the humane nature is capable, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. withal his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for his people, (as ſo many curious engravings) ſpeak not a little his beauty to theſe who have intereſt therein. This is ſignified by the Lords <hi>engraving the graving:</hi> of this ſtone, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it as a precious jewel, and adorning it by his Art.</p>
                  <p>Two benefits are promiſed to flow from Chriſt the Prieſt to his people; the firſt whereof is, remiſſion and purging away of fins by the ſacrifice upon the croſſe, once for all, which needs not to be repeated as the Jewiſh ſacrifices were, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. and 10.12, 14. This is promiſed to the whole elect and myſtical body of Chriſt, figured by the Jewes and their promiſed land, beſide what peculiar relation it may have to them and their land, that their ſins, being taken away by Chriſt, ſhould not hinder him to ſavour them, nor the land for their ſake; but ſhould be looked on in due time, not as polluted and ſpewing them out for ſin, not poſſeſſed and over-run by enemies.

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Remiſſion and removall of ſinne is the choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſts people, and the riſe of other mercies, <hi>I will remove iniquity,</hi> is the fruit of Chriſts coming to the world and of his glory as Mediator. 2. Sinne is pardoned and removed onely by the merit and vertue of Chriſts one ſacrifice, only once offered and not to be repeated on what pretext ſoever, for, ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is removed <hi>in one day.</hi> 3. Chriſts own peculiar and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven people of the Father, are they upon whom the priviledge of pardon and ſanctification is conferred, and on whoſe behalfe Chriſt offered up himſelfe to procure theſe benefits; for it is the iniquity <hi>of that land</hi> (a type of the elect Church,) that is removed.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond benefit flowing from the former, is the taking away of all trouble, and the fear of trouble, which ſinne procures; and the giving of peace, repreſented by peoples walking abroad, and daring, in the open fields under ſhades, to invite and call one another to feaſts and enjoyment of the fruits of peace; which promiſe is ſpiritually performed to all the elect when they are aſſured that God is at peace with them; and is ſometimes outwardly performed to the Church, when it is for her good, beſide what <hi>Iſrael</hi> may expect when they ſhall turne to Chriſt. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. True and ſound peace comes only from Chriſt, and from the ſenſe of the pardon of ſinne through his blood, which theſe who have fled to Chriſt, ought to take as their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to reſt confidently upon, whatever danger there be, and feed upon as the choiceſt of dainties and feaſts; for, when ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is removed, <hi>In that day, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, ſhall ye call every man his neighbour, under the vine and under the fig-tree.</hi> 2. As outward peace and tranquillity in the viſible Church and Nation where it is, is a great mercy if it be well improven; ſo it ſhall not be wanting when it is for her good: for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is put in her charter for that alſo, and left in the hand of her wiſe and tender guide, to diſpenſe it as he ſees may be for her profit, being <hi>the Lord of hoſtes</hi> to make it forth-coming for her, when he pleaſeth. 3. As it is a token of a bleſſed and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169977:47"/>through peace, when with outward and forreigne enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God removes inteſtine diſſenſions; and as amity among the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of a Nation, eſpecially in the Church, is a bleſſing and favour in its own kinde; So true ſpiritual peace ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and improven by mutual godly Society, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of conditions and experiences for common edification: This is ſignified unto us, in that peace whether inward or outward is deſcribed, by <hi>calling every man his neighbour,</hi> living in amity; and inviting to mutual feaſts and banquets.</p>

In all which alluſion is made to the candleſtick in the Tabernacle and Temple, ſomething being added to ſit the viſion to the preſent ſcope. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The conſolations and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a people following God, are ſo far from being raſh imaginations of mens brain who are imployed in Commiſſion, that Chriſt hath more to communicate then they are able to comprehend; for this end is it marked, that the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>uzed up by the Angel; and put upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this viſion, that he may carry it to the Church. 2. As bur weakneſſe is ſuch while we are environed with mortality, that we cannot long bear up in ſpiritual duties; So great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in hard times, and when there are ſmall deſervings, will rather overcharge our narrow hearts with aſtoniſhment, then be entertained and reſted on by faith; for, here the Prophet is <hi>as one aſleep,</hi> with wearineſſe and aſtoniſhment. 3. There is need of much upſtirring from our natural lazineſſe and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indiſpoſition, when we are imployed in holy duties, if we would reap benefit by them, and ſee into the riches of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be had in them; for, <hi>the Angel waled me us out of a ſleep,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. 4. Loving kindneſſe in Chriſt, will both prevent his people with mercy, and come over all impediments, which they lay in the way of their own comfort; for, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels hath viſions ready, when the Prophet dreamed not of them, and wakens him to ſee them, that he may communicate them to the Church. 5. Albeit only the ſcope of this viſion be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the Angels anſwer to the firſt queſtion, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his ſecond queſtion doth only enquire concerning what was rare in the viſion, the parts of the candleſtick being already known to ſuch as underſtood the meaning of theſe types in the Temple; yet we may, for our inſtruction, take up the ſumme of this viſion as expounding the typicall candleſtick in this, that nothing can be done in the Church without Gods preparing of inſtruments, for directing, adifying, and comforting of her, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169977:48"/>without his giving the graces of his Spirit to every one, to carry on the work in his ſtation. And ſo, 1. The Temple here repreſents the Church to be enlightened by Chriſt, ſhe being in her ſelfe but dark and void of light and comfort till he come and appear in her, and for her, and make her light. 2. The Miniſtery appointed of Chriſt for the direction, edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and comfort of the Church, are here (though elſewhere and in ſome reſpect it repreſent the Church it ſelfe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20.) repreſented by the <hi>candleſtick,</hi> who ſhould be pure, that they may be precious in his ſight as <hi>gold,</hi> and who ought to ſhine by purity and holineſſe of life, and be inſtrumental in making the Church a ſhining light in a dark world. 3. <hi>The bowle upon the top</hi> of the candleſtick, which immediately receives the oile, doth fitly repreſent Chriſt as Mediator, the head and ſtore-houſe of his Church, to whom is intruſted all fulneſſe of giſts and graces for the Churches behoof. 4. The variety and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of giſts communicate by Chriſt, for the good and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, is repreſented by <hi>ſeven lamps,</hi> all tending to one common end of burning and ſhining. 5. The way of deriving grace from Chriſt to his ſervants, by ordained and ſanctified meanes, eſpecially by his Covenant, our dependance, and the bands of communion betwixt him and his people, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by <hi>ſeven pipes</hi> going betwixt the bowle and the lamps. The reſt of this ſhadow and type being afterward expounded by the Angel, we ſhall ſeek it there. <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. The Lords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to teach this Doctrine, as it were, twice to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, once in the type, and again in the explication; may teach us the certainty of the thing it ſelfe, our incapacity, and what need there is of ſtudying it again and again.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet deſiring to underſtand the meaning of this type, is prepared for an anſwer by the Angels drawing out a new and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169977:48"/>expreſſe confeſſion of his ignorance, to humble him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods calling of his people to enjoy manifeſtations of himſelfe, calls upon them to deſire to profit, and be inſtructed by them, as ſenſible of their own ſhort coming; for, the Prophet <hi>anſwered, ſaying, What are theſe?</hi> as being called by this viſion to ſeek more light and edification. 2. Even when God is acting and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before our eyes, we will remaine ignorant and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, till he come and open our eyes; the mercy of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a new mercy, after we have had the mercy it ſelfe; for the Prophet ſeeing all this, muſt put the queſtion to the Angel; <hi>What are theſe, my Lord?</hi> 3. It is not unuſual; nor obſcure in Scripture-language, to give unto the ſigne the name of the thing ſignified or repreſented by it, without any change of the one into the other, but only becauſe of typicall or Sacramental repreſentation; for, here the Prophet enquiring, <hi>What are theſe?</hi> doth not profeſſe ignorance of theſe things in themſelves, (for he expreſſeth the contrary unto the Angel, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.) but what they were in that ſtate, or what they ſignified and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. And ſo in the anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>This is the Word, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is not that the candleſtick was that promiſe, but that it ſignified the thing promiſed, and was a repreſentation of it. 4 Chriſt requires of theſe whom he will teach, that they be ſenſible of their own ignorance, and humble in the ſenſe of it; and that not in a ſuperficial way, but that it be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted, and their heart again and again convinced of it, that the mercy of Chriſts help may be the more eſteemed; therefore albeit the firſt queſtion imply the Prophets confeſſion of his ignorance, yet Chriſt will not ſatisfie him, till he be more humb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
                  <p>The Prophet being thus prepared, gets an explication of the ſcope of the whole viſion, in two particulars, in the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and with him all the people, are informed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods way of carrying on his own work, that they might
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169977:49"/>not faint, though outward probable meanes of armies and ſtrength of men fail them, but rely on God, who is alſufficient by his own Spirit and intrinſecal power and vertue to ſet up his Church, to preſerve and furniſh it with all things needfull with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe means, and who uſeth to lay theſe oft-times by, that his own immediate power may ſhine. Thus the explication anſwers well unto the type; for as the candleſtick was conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplyed with oile, that the lamps might burn, without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane induſtry, the Olive-trees pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing in oile of themſelves, ſo ſhould this work go on, without any meanes that might in probability carry on ſuch a work. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing when the Lords people are inſtructed, and made wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the way of his working, and carrying on a work in his Church, that they be not cruſhed under miſtakes, as thinking that he is about to ruine, and deſert it, when indeed he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the beſt way to perfect it; and here the Lords own teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is requiſite for underſtanding his deep counſels in ſo farre as may be for our good: therefore the Lord himſelfe teacheth <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> in this point, that he ſtumble not. 2. As all that are imployed about the work of God, and are cordially affected to it, will finde it lie near their heart; ſo eſpecially theſe who have any place of power among Gods people, and in carrying on his work, ought to take ſuch a burden of it, as may ſend them to ſeek incouragement from Heaven; for, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> needs a particular word, <hi>This is the Word of the Lord unto Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel.</hi> 3. Albeit might and probable meanes do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtand in oppoſition to Gods power in his work, but may ſometimes be ſubordinate, as principal workers, and inſtruments by which he works: yet, 1. Might and power are not to be doated on, nor leaned to when they are given to the Church, but Gods own power ſhould be immediately eyed, which muſt ſtirre up, enable, and bleſſe theſe meanes before they can do any thing, and who will take meanes away when they are truſted to, and he forgotten. So long as God ſtands obliged by his power to do for his people and work, they are not to be anxious though all probable meanes faile them; ſeeing he, who only makes meanes active and effectuall, can fulfill his own counſell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, being ſtill <hi>the Lord of hoſtes,</hi> when viſible armies fail. 3. It is the Lords way in carrying on his work, to lay by much of humane power and probable meanes, that he may extoll his own power and commend his love to his people and work, when
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169977:49"/>much of him, and little of the creature, is ſeen about them. All this is imported in this information, <hi>Not by might, nor by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but by my Spirit,</hi> or, power and vertue, <hi>ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> His power is only to be truſted in, and to be truſted in what ever elſe appear, and it will be eminently ſeen, and other help be obſcured and laid by in Temple-building.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond particular in the explication of this viſion, is to aſſure <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> concerning the ſucceſſe of his building the Temple, (as a type of Chriſt the builder of the Church by his own power,) that as the candleſtick, furniſhed by the Olive-trees, did continually ſhine and hold out light, ſo the Lords power ſhould carry on this work, not only without, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all humane power and oppoſition; which ſhould be ſo far from hindring the work, that it ſhould help to pave a way to it; and the ſame power ſhould bring this work in <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> hand to a perfection, to the commendation of the grace of God, and joy of all, teſtified by their acclamations when the work is perfected, and by their prayer that God would continue to bleſſe it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts work in his Church, whether externally reforming and ſetting up an houſe, or internally converting, may have oppoſition in the way, which will ſeem as inſuperable, as to carry a great traine or make weak perſons climbe over high and ſteep hills; and ſuch a work will not go on without exerciſe and feares; for, here is a <hi>great mountaine</hi> in the way, whereby in relation to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> was ſignified the Monarchy of <hi>Perſia,</hi> in ſo farre as it obſtructed the work, and the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan faction about them: and in relation to Chriſt and his Church, it ſignifieth all the oppoſition that devils and men (eſpecially great ones) in the world, can raiſe to hinder that work. 2. Whatever great oppoſites may ſeem to be in their own eyes, or in the thoughts of the fainting people of God, yet in Gods eyes they are nothing and contemptible, and his Spirit is provoked at their preſumption in undertaking ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and that they ſhould offer to croſſe his beloved work and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169977:50"/>people; for, <hi>Who art thou, O great mountaine?</hi> imports his contemning of them, his indignation againſt them, and that he will make them know themſelves better then to adventure on ſuch a work. 3. Not only will oppoſition not prove ſo hurtfull as it appears terrible, and be eaſie when the Lords people comes to it, and not hinder the work; but the over-ruling hand of God will make oppoſition a meanes of furthering and carrying on the work, which it was appointed and intended to hinder, to the praiſe of the glory of his own wiſdome and power, who is above enemies in that wherein they deal proudly, for, the great mountaine <hi>ſhall become a plaine,</hi> not only not a mountaine and eaſie to walk over, but ſhall pave a way, and fill up valleys, and hollow places, that the work may go on. This was accompliſhed in the type to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and the Jewes, when <hi>Darius</hi> by his Decree promoved the work, and compeſced their enemies about them, and made them furniſh what might advance the work, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. and is daily brought to paſſe by Chriſt in making all the plots of devils and men, and all their debates, contribute to clear up truth, and promove the work of converſion and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own people. 4. As inſtruments, how weak ſoever their honeſt and ſingle minding of Gods work, and not driving their own intereſt alongſt with it, is the way to make it proſper, and to make oppoſition ineffectual; (for, ſuch a one in the type was <hi>Zerubbabel, before</hi> whom <hi>the mountaine becomes a plain:</hi>) So Chriſt being party to all oppoſition againſt the Church, is ground of hope to her, that it ſhall not prevaile, but be made ſubſervient to her good; for, it is he in the ſubſtance, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>before Zerubbabel thou ſhalt become a pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ne.</hi> 5. As it is the Lords great mercy (yea, and his way, where a people cleave to him) that he brings a begun external work of Reformation to a perfection ſuch as is attainable, in deſpite of all oppoſition, however it be oft interrupted, and go but ſlowly on, and by degrees; (for, ſo was it here in the type, <hi>He ſhall bring forth the head-ſtone thereof,</hi> alluding to ſome cuſtome, wherein as the foundation-ſtone; ſo alſo the capeſtone was laid in the Mageſtrates ſight, or by himſelfe:) So, it is Chriſts prerogative and way, to perfect his begun good work, and to carry on his myſtical body, and every member thereof, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees unto perfection; for, the ſubſtance of this promiſe is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in him, and his work about his people, <hi>He ſhall bring forth the head-ſtone thereof.</hi> 6. As there is matter of joy in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169977:50"/>the going on of Chriſts work; ſo hath he reſerved much joy for his people in the perfecting of it; for, as ſome ſhouted for joy at the laying of the foundation, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.11. ſo more is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding; <hi>He ſhall bring out the Head-ſtone with ſhoutings:</hi> as a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the joy of the Lords people, when a long deſired and much interrupted work of Reformation comes to ſome period; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and joy that ſhall be when Chriſt preſents his Spouſe perfect and compleat before the Father. 7. The Lords work among his people is ſo carried on, as not only free grace begins it, but the further it goes on, grace is the more to be magnified, and moſt of all ſeen at the very cloſe of it: yea, any perfection it attains to within time, muſt be upheld by the ſame grace that gave it; for, ſo it was in the type here; this ſhouting; <hi>Grace, grace unto it,</hi> is both an acclamation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the much and multiplied favour of God that had ſhined in that work, till its perfection; and alſo a prayer that God would let out his grace, and bleſſe that Temple in the uſe for which it was built. 8. Chriſts work in and about his people, is ſo full of tender favour and loving kindneſſe, as may bring unto him the glory of abundant grace from all impartial Judges, and will one day proclaim it before all the world; for, this acclamation and applauding of the work made ſo beautiful and compleat by grace, making every one commend and wiſh well to it, is nothing elſe but a commending him and his grace who made it ſuch, and leads his people to expect that day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>he ſhall be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169977:51"/>Promiſes of the Word are faithful and worthy of our truſt and confidence, as being the Word of him, who by his Word gives being to all things; this repetition of the promiſe, and that as <hi>the Word of Jehovah,</hi> ſhewes, not only how ready we are to diſtruſt, but how ſerious he is in promiſing, and will not eat in, but make good what he ſaith, ſo that his Church may lean to it. 2. It is a peculiar proof of Gods favour to a land, when the Lord not only grants a Reformation, and the building of an habitation of pure doctrine and ordinances for his own Name amongſt them, but when he perfecteth it ſpeedily, and in the age wherein it begins, and is not provoked by their ſins, to leave the generation whom he brings out of bondage, to periſh in a wilderneſſe, before they come to ſuch a promiſed land: therefore it is a ſpecial promiſe to the Jewes in the type, not only that the Temple ſhould be perfected, but that <hi>the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this houſe, his hands ſhall alſo finiſh it.</hi> 3. However Chriſts works and counſels in the world may ſeem to lie long interrupted, yet where he begins he is unchangeable, and endures to all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſee it perfected; for, this promiſe is alſo true of him in the ſubſtance: <hi>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this houſe, his hands ſhall alſo finiſh it.</hi> 4. The Lords diſpenſations toward his reconciled people, are then rightly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, when the fruits of Chriſts being employed as Mediatour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them appears, and his fidelity, love and care of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſeen to ſhine in them: and they are ſtill to be ſtudied, over and over again till this be ſeen, that ſo Chriſts love may be ſhed abroad in their hearts, and he become high and precious in their eſtimation; for, the event of this ſucceſſe is, <hi>And thou ſhalt know that the Lord of hoſtes hath ſent me unto you,</hi> where the ſpeech is directed unto the Prophet, for the good and inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Lord ſubjoynes the reaſon of this ſo frequently reported promiſe, and the uſe of the doctrine, which is to reprove the corrupt judgment of that people, who judged of that work by the ſmall beginnings thereof; and their diſcouragement flowing from it, as fearing all they did would be in vain, that it ſhould not be like the firſt Temple, and ſo their enemies ſhould mock them, as well as the ancient men wept, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. This the Lord reproves and promiſes they ſhould yet rejoyce in ſeeing <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> (a type of Chriſt) as chief director, making to work, and by conſidering that Gods conſtant providence, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on Chriſt, and on the Church for his ſake, as <hi>chap.</hi> 3.9. goeth alſo through the world for their good, to provide what may proſper, and to obſtruct what may hinder the work. <hi>Doct</hi> 1. It is the Lords way in his work, whether with the Church or particular ſouls, to begin at ſmall things, promiſing very little, that he may ſet forth the glory of his power, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a work out of them, which men could never have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: for, there is <hi>a day of ſmall thingr,</hi> which ends in a glorious Temple. 2. Judging of Gods work, by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, or the firſt view, and undervaluing of it, when it ſatisfies not our mould, or ſeems not to promiſe much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcouraged thereby, is a ſin which the Lords people ſhould be aſhamed to own or avow, conſidering how much God will bring out of ſmall things, and that cheriſhing of them is the way to make them great; for, <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things?</hi> ſaith he, intimating that none ought to take with it; and this ſin of <hi>deſpiſing</hi> doth not break forth only in open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and mockery, but may ſhelter it ſelf under the pretence of being ſorry, that things are ſo little, (as theſe do, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.12.) may expreſſe it ſelf in heartleſſe lying by from duty, as the Jewes did here, and men may alſo pretend that they would not deſpiſe ſmall things, but that they are grieved becauſe they can
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169977:52"/>ſee nothing; for, ſo did their diſcouragement account of theſe ſmall things, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2 3. 3. Chriſts graciouſneſſe and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe toward his people, is oft-times ſuch, as to refute their greateſt diſcouragements and miſtakes with mercy, and ſilence their groundleſſe complaints with giving them matter of joy, and cauſing them to rejoyce becauſe of it; for, <hi>deſpiſers ſhall rejoyce,</hi> ſaith he. 4. Gods begun work in his people and Church, how contemptible ſoever it appear, will end in joy to his people, the hope whereof ſhould ſilence preſent diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for, <hi>Who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things? for they ſhall rejoyce.</hi> 5. So long as Chriſt hath his hand at his own work, and hath not given it over, although it be not perfected, yet it affords matter of joy, conſidering that it ſaith, he hath not yet abhorred his work, and will perfect it: for, in the type this was one ground of joy; <hi>They ſhall ſee the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel,</hi> to wit, as chief director of the work, going about it, and ſeeing that all be right built; which agrees moſt compleatly to Chriſt in the ſubſtance, who is himſelf the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-builder. 6. Not only is it to be reckoned, that where Chriſt hath begun a work, he is ſtill about it till it be perfected; but in ſpecial he may be reckoned working, when he is fitting his people to be ſtones in his building, and (if it were even by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als) cutting off ſuperfluities of naughtineſſe from his work and people, which might deforme his building, albeit in the mean time the work do not appear viſibly to advance; this may be ſignified by <hi>the plummet-line,</hi> the ſigne of his being at work, which is the inſtrument whereby builders try and ſquare their building, and cut off all excreſcences in it, and is as needful as to lay on more ſtones upon it to raiſe it higher. Chriſt may be very buſie at work when we are ill pleaſed with it, and when our ſenſe is not ſatisfied that it is ſo: and working under ground, by diſcoveries, purging, humility, trials, &amp;c. is as needful as that we long moſt after. 7. A right ſight of the vigilant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, which is employed to have a care of Chriſt and his Church, and governes and orders all things in the world, ſo as may beſt contribute for the good and welfare of the Church, may afford matter of joy in the midſt of many diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, as declaring that his people are much in his heart, when his providence in all the world is with an eye to their good, and allowing us to caſt all our cares and feares on him, who hath all power in his hands; for this is another ground of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169977:52"/>joy, they <hi>ſhall ſee theſe ſeven;</hi> or, the perfect eye of providence on that chief ſtone, and all the building, which alſo are <hi>the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</hi>

Unto which queſtion (the Prophet being again prepared and humbled with a new ſenſe of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>v.</hi> 13.) anſwer is returned, <hi>v.</hi> 14. For underſtanding wherof, Conſider, 1. That by the two Olive-trees, it is not clear to underſtand only the graces of God poured out on his Church, for that is indeed ſignified by the oile, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. but here the reſolution is concerning the trees that furniſhed the oile; Nor yet are we in general to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them of a fountain of bounty in God, for there can be no reaſon given why that ſhould be compared to <hi>two</hi> trees, and be ſaid <hi>to ſtand before the Lord.</hi> But by them we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Chriſt anointed in his Prieſtly, (which includes his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169977:53"/>Prophetical) and Kingly office, who was chief in this work, and in furniſhing all inſtruments, who furniſhes his Church, and ſerves his Father in the work of Redemption, and is cared for by him, as will be expreſſely cleared to us, <hi>chap.</hi> 6, 12, 13. Conſider, 2. That the Angel anſwering both his queſtions in one, leads us to underſtand the one by the other, in ſo far as is needful; and therefore we may conceive, that either that of the branches is not touched as needleſſe, or pointing out on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fit wayes of communicating himſelf to his peoples capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the pipes not being able to receive the oile of the whole tree at once, or that branches only now furniſhing, imported Chriſts communicating himſelf in a ſmall meaſure, in this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical work of building the Temple in reſpect of what he had, and was to communicate in the building of his Church under the Goſpel, or if we will ſtretch it further, it may take in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> the one anointed Prieſt, the other a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of their anointed Kings, who however as inſtruments in the work, they were reſembled by the burning lamps, getting furniture from the bowle; yet In reſpect of their office among that people, and their influence upon all inſtruments of building the Temple, they were types of Chriſt, and ſo might be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by two little branches, reſembling him the great Olive-tree; and this interpretation ſeems to have ground, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.4. where as the two witneſſes are reſembled to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> in regard of the effects of their Miniſtery, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.

                     </gap>triſt and his offices, till we come to <hi>chap.</hi> 6. We may here learn, 1. When Chriſt is doing much for his people, he may yet let ſomewhat be wanting, to the end he may ſtir us up to prayer, employing him, whereby to draw prepared mercies out of his hand, that ſo we may not only have the mercie, but be confirmed and comforted in the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our perſons and ſervices, by his granting our deſires; for, this viſion is ſo explained in the former anſwer, as leaves room for new information upon new prayer and enquiry. 2. Chriſt doth not allow that his people ſhould reſt upon the habits or ſeed of graces within them, nor upon old ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169977:53"/>but where he is about to manifeſt himſelf, he keeps grace in exerciſe, and puts his people to frequent actings of it; for, albeit the Prophet had been but lately humbled in the ſenſe of his ignorance, <hi>v.</hi> 5. yet here he is put to it afreſh again, <hi>v</hi> 13.3. Chriſts humbling of his people when they ſeek to him, and his giving ſuch anſwers at firſt, as may contribute to that end, gives them no ground to think, that either he doth reject, or will deny their ſuit, but rather aſſures them, that he is making way for a ſatisfactory anſwer; for, Chriſts humbling of the Prophet, hinders him not from ſatisfaction in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. 4. Chriſt ſuſtaines very many relations to his people, and is very much to be ſeen in her furniture and well-being; for, many things in this type point at him; he is <hi>the Olive-trees,</hi> having as God, and in his mediatory office all fulneſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both active and willing of himſelf, to communicate it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their capacity. He alſo may be pointed at in his two offices <hi>by the two golden pipes,</hi> conveighing the oile from the trees to the Candleſtick, it being through his merit as Prieſt, and his efficacy as King, that the fulneſſe in him becomes ours, and that gives us allowance to depend on him for it: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he hath all fulneſſe, and hath found a way to make it ours, ſo is he <hi>the bowle</hi> to keep it, and to guide us and it, and be forth-coming for our good with it. In a word, Chriſt is to be ſeen all in all to his people. 5. The work of the Churches Redemption and ſalvation by Chriſt, is a work well-pleaſing to God, however he be the party offended, and in doing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt doth acceptable ſervice to his Father, and is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cared for by him; for, the <hi>two anoinied ones,</hi> (or Chriſt in his offices, repreſented by theſe trees, or, <hi>ſons of oile</hi>) <hi>ſtand by the Lord,</hi> as doing him ſervice in his office, and upheld by him; and ſo God in Chriſt reconciles the world, and is at peace with his people. 6. As God is bleſſed over all, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient in himſelf, ſo he hath given, daily gives, and will give proof hereof, in carrying on the ſalvation of his Church through Chriſt, making his power and dominion in all the earth contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereunto: therefore in this work is he named <hi>the Lord of the whole earth.</hi> 7. As any meaſure of furniture is given to any member of the Church, that it may be made uſe of for the good of the whole; ſo all ſuch as deſire to be uſeful in their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ought to be much in dependance on God, and to ſtudy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169977:54"/>to ſtand in his favour, and be under his care: for ſo much doth this anſwer, as it may concerne <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> the types, teach us. Any oile they have is to be poured out for the good of the whole, and they are to <hi>ſtand by the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>THis chapter containes a ſixth and ſeventh viſion, holding forth doctrine different from the former: wherein is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſin continued in, would bring on private calamities, and having filled up the meaſure thereof, would alſo draw down publick judgements upon the whole Nation: and ſo in the firſt viſion, under the type of a large flying roll, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. is repreſented the curſe of God, ready to be executed upon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the firſt and ſecond table, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and to cut off their houſe and familie, <hi>v.</hi> 4. In the ſecond viſion, under the type of an <hi>Ephah</hi> or meaſure, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. and of a woman, repreſenting wickedneſſe, caſt and cloſed therein with a talent of lead, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. and all carried away together to the land of <hi>Shinar, v.</hi> 9, 10, 11. is repreſented, that when the Land ſhould fill up the meaſure of their iniquity, they ſhould be carried into captivity as formerly they had been.</p>

                     <p>THen I turned, and lift up mine eyes, and looked, and behold, a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roll.</p>

                     <p>And hee ſaid unto me, What ſeeſt thou? and I anſwered, I ſee a flying roll, the length thereof <hi>is</hi> twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord having hitherto comforted this people with ſweet viſions and promiſes of the proſpering and bleſſing of the work, doth now ſeaſon theſe with hard threatenings for their ſin: ſhewing, that their own ſins not only hindered the work, but (notwithſtanding any great things he had done, or was to do for them) would draw plagues on particular ſinners, and if they perſevered, would utterly ſubvert and overturn the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169977:54"/>all which their former experience might not a little help them to lay to heart. The type of the firſt viſion (containing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings of publike calamities for ſin) repreſented unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, is a flying roll, or large parchment written upon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome of writing books in theſe times, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the threatned curſes of the law againſt private ſinners, now going forth in execution. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As ſin is ſufficient to obſtruct the performance of glorious promiſes, where there is no other enemie; ſo Gods kindneſſe to a people will not hinder, but that he ſhould reckon with them for their ſins: therfore are theſe viſions ſubjoyned to the former, to ſhew them what was the cauſe of their low condition, and of the Temples coming ill ſpeed, and to warne them what they might yet expect, notwithſtanding former promiſes. 2. Even theſe who are moſt intent about ſpiritual things, have need to ſtir up themſelves, and to be ſtirred up of God, to be yet more diligent and exact; for, the Prophet ſeeing the <hi>roll,</hi> is ſtirred up to conſider it better by a new queſtion, <hi>What ſeeſt thou?</hi> 3. The right way of underſtanding and taking up calamities for our uſe, is to look upon them through the proſpect of the Word, which will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the author and the procuring cauſe of trouble, and the uſe we ſhould make of them: therefore are the calamities to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted compared to a <hi>roll,</hi> with relation to the book of the law threatening them, which we ſhould conſider when we feel the ſtroak. 4. The judgements denounced againſt ſinners and ſin by the Word of God, will not ſtill lie by as if they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, but will break forth in execution, and will ſpeedily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and bring down the rebel; therefore this judgement is not now lying within the Temple, but gone forth and viſible; <hi>yea, a flying roll,</hi> ſwiftly to take the prey. 5. As the threatenings denounced in the Word-are ſad when they are executed, ſo the execution will be exactly anſwerable to the threatening, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſinners may dream to the contrary: for, the dimenſions of this roll, <hi>being in length twenty cubits, and in breadth ten cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi> doth not only ſhew that it was a large roll, containing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curſes, (being written on both ſides, <hi>v.</hi> 3.) to meet with all ſins, and make the ſinner compleatly miſerable, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly it may be conceived to have relation to the houſes into which it ſhould enter, which being ordinarily twice as long as broad, imports that the curſe ſhould fill the houſe, or, to the porch of the Temple, from whence the roll came, and where the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169977:55"/>Law was taught, which being of the ſame ſize with this roll, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.3. doth import that the execution ſhould be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as large as the threatening pronounced, and anſwerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>Then ſaid he unto we, This <hi>is</hi> the curſe that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that ſlealeth, ſhall be cut off <hi>as</hi> on this ſide, according to it, and every on that ſweareth ſhall be cut off <hi>as</hi> on that ſide, according to it.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This type is expounded to ſignifie the Lords curſe, going ſorth to do execution in all the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and to cut off ſinners againſt the firſt and ſecond table of the Law, and that according to the contents of the roll, which was written on both ſides, with relation to the two tables of the Law. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever be the particular puniſhment inflicted by God for ſin, yet this is ſeriouſly to be laid to heart, that every ſuch puniſhment hath in its boſome a curſe, till the ſinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked thereby, flee to Chriſt, who became a curſe, that his own may inherit a bleſſing; for, <hi>This is the curſe that goeth forth,</hi> ſaith he. 2. The Lord is an impartial avenger of ſin, when it is perſevered in without repentance: and when other meanes are ineffectual, he will not ſpare to cut off the deſperate ſinner; for, the curſe goes <hi>over the face of the whole earth,</hi> or, <hi>land, and every one ſhall be cut off,</hi> without exception, who are guilty. 3. The Lord will not ſpare, but indifferently puniſh ſin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the firſt or ſecond table, in avoiding of both which the Lords people are to teſtifie their ſincerity; this is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>cutting off of every one that ſtealeth, and every one that ſweareth;</hi> all ſins againſt both Tables being comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe two, which were frequent in theſe times, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves groſſe, and the roll having curſes <hi>on this ſide, and this fide,</hi> according to which both ſorts of ſinners were to be cut off. 4. When a people are delivered out of ſore troubles, and yet their luſts are not mortified, they ordinarily prove covetous, falſe, and oppreſſing, as labouring by all meanes to make up theſe things that trouble hath ſtript them of; therefore is there a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular threatening againſt <hi>every one that ſtealeth,</hi> it being ariſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169977:55"/>ſin at their return from the captivity, for they went <hi>every man to his own houſe,</hi> Haggai 1.9. were cruel oppreſſors, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. yea, and robbed God of tythes and offerings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. 5. Covetous and falſe men, in their bargains with men, will make no bones of impiety and perjury, if that may help to gain their point; for with the former is joyned, <hi>every one that ſweareth,</hi> which is expounded, <hi>v.</hi> 4. to be <hi>ſwearing falſly by Gods Name.</hi>

                     <p>I will bring it forth, ſaith the LORD of hoſts and it ſhall enter into the honſe of the thiefe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of him that ſweareth falſely by my Name: and it ſhall remaine in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it with the timber thereof, and the ſtones thereof.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The puniſhment of theſe ſins is more particularly declared, that the curſe ſhall not only cut off the ſinner himſelf, but ſhall purſue his houſe and familie, and like a moth conſume it, till it fall about his eares, and ruine him and his <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God is the executor of his own threatened judgements, and will make them effectual, oppoſe him who will; <hi>I will bring it forth, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 2. Vengeance will purſue the ſinner, even in that condition wherein he thinks himſelf moſt ſecure, nor ſhall he be able to reſiſt or remove it, till it perform the work for which it is ſent; for it ſhall enter, <hi>even into the houſe,</hi> where he thinks to live ſecurely, and it ſhall <hi>remain in the midſt of the houſe.</hi> 3. Sinners do oft-times not only draw down judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon themſelves, but do alſo provoke God to ruine their houſes and families thereby, that they may be monuments of his ſeverity, and warnings to all others; for, <hi>it ſhall abide in the midſt of the houſe, and ſhall conſume it with the timber thereof, and the ſtones thereof.</hi> 4. The Lord needs not make uſe of violent remedies to take order with impenitent ſinners, and their families, but can by his curſe, and removal of his bleſſing from what they have, make it inſenſibly melt away, ſo that they ſhall be ruined, and themſelves cannot well tell how; for ſo much is imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>Not to trouble the Reader with diverſity of apprehenſions, concerning the ſcope of this viſion, whereof ſo little is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, and that ſo darkly by the Angel; That which appeares to come neareſt truth is, that as in the former viſion was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how the Lord would purſue the ſin of particular perſons with private calamities; ſo in this is declared that he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo puniſh the whole Nation, and caſt them out of their land, when the meaſure of their iniquity ſhould be filled up. And this the Lord in this viſion not only warnes them of, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had formerly come upon them, but denounces and foretels for the time to come. To this all the parts of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion agree; whereof the firſt is an Ephah coming forth in view, which was one of the dry meaſures among the Jewes, and is generally taken for any meaſure. This the Angel inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets to be <hi>their reſemblance,</hi> or, <hi>eye in all the earth,</hi> or, <hi>in all the land,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Judea;</hi> that is, that meaſure, which by little and little is filled up to the brim, repreſents or reſembles the meaſure of their ſins, which God in his long-ſuffering and patience bears with, till by every one in the land, their putting in a part, and adding ſin to ſin, all of them make up an heap to fill the meaſure, and ripen them for judgement; in all which the Providence and eye of God is upon them to obſerve and meaſure up their ſins, as by an Ephah till it be full. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord purſues ſin with many particular calamities, and neither the corrected nor others are bettered thereby, it is a preſage that the land is ripening fot a national ſtroak; ſo much doth the connexion of this viſion with the former teach. 2. Such is the Lords long ſuffering and patience, that he doth not proceed upon every provocation to plague his people, till ſin he come to an height and paſt remedy, and till that meaſure be filled up, which he in his long-ſuffering and providence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169977:56"/>for, here is an <hi>Ephab</hi> to be filled up, ere it be carried away. 3. When a land is ripening for judgement, and declining from God, the ſins of every particular rank &amp; perſon in it, adds to the provocation, and contributes to encreaſe the flame, and haſten the judgement: for, <hi>the Ephah is their reſemblance in all the land.</hi> Every one in the land contributes to fill it up, and however the ſins of every one apart may ſeem little, yet being put together in the meaſure, they will amount to much. 4. Albeit God be not alwayes ſmiting for ſin, yet he is not aſleep, but carefully obſerving how men fill up the meaſure, who they are that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes moſt to that effect, that they may drink the deeper of the cup of judgement, and obſerving when it is full, that he may ariſe and puniſh: for, thus the words will alſo reade, <hi>This is their eye in all the land,</hi> or the Ephah repteſents Gods Providence upon them, obſerving and meaſuring the ſins of every one, and of all in common.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the viſion is a woman in the Ephah, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting that ſinful and wicked people and Nation, having now filled up the meaſure of their ſin: and a talent of lead, preſſing her down in the Ephah, ſignifying a concluding of them under ſin without pardon, and a keeping them under their guilt, till they be puniſhed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Sin perſevered in by a land, will at laſt fill up the meaſure, and Gods patience toward them will come to a period: for, <hi>the woman</hi> repreſenting wickedneſſe, growes up and fills the Ephah, wherein ſhe ſits. 2. When the Lord contends with a land by judgements, it is not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ordinary eſcapes and infirmities, as for groſſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty come to an height; for, <hi>this is wickedneſſe,</hi> ſaith he, or a repreſentation of that people, now become extremely wicked, which is the cauſe of the threatened captivity. 3.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169977:57"/>with the ſin of his people, and they yet perſevere, it is righteous with him to give them up to their own hearts, and leave them as captives under the power of impenitency and guilt, till he, without any altering of his ſentence plague them: for, <hi>Wickedneſſe is caſt into the midſt of the Ephah, and the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof:</hi> that is, they are left under the power of their ſin, till vengeance be executed.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The laſt part of the viſion, is of two women carrying away the Ephah, and the woman therein to the land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and dwell there. Whereby is ſignified, that when their cup was full, they ſhould ſpeedily be carried into captivity out of their own land, where they ſhould long abide, as in a dwelling place. They are ſaid to be carried captives <hi>into the land of Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi> or, <hi>Babylon, Gen.</hi> 11.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> partly to expreſſe their future captivity by the Romanes, in ſuch a way, as might be moſt ſenſible to them who had been captives in <hi>Babel</hi> before; and partly, becauſe in their ſecond captivity many of them were ſcattered in theſe parts, becauſe of the many Jewes who abode ſtill there. As for the other circumſtance of the viſion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>two women who had the winde in their wings,</hi> or were helped to flee by the winde, it were curioſity to determine of them further, then as pointing out the vanity of that peoples wayes, which ſhould drive them out of their land: or rather the inſtruments of their captivity, who are reſembled to women, only to agree with the reſt of the viſion, wherein the ſinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is reſembled to a woman, and to two women, as being a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169977:57"/>competent number for his work, as the diſciples went out by paires. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A people abuſing afflictions, and marvellous deliverances from it, by their ſinning yet more, may expect their afflictions will be returned upon them in harder meaſure: for, a new and ſorer captivity, and longer dwelling under it is here threatened upon their renewed provocations. 2. The Lord hath ſufficiency of inſtruments at his command, to execute his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined judgements, who being employed by him againſt his ſinful people, ſhall finde all things concurring with them to carry on that work: this is ſignified <hi>by two women,</hi> enough to carry the Ephah, and by <hi>their wings like the wings of a ſtorke,</hi> enabling them to flee, and do the work violently and ſwiftly, and to flee high <hi>betwixt the heaven and the earth,</hi> above the reach of any oppoſition made unto them by men, and <hi>by the winde in their wings,</hi> providence, as it were, concurring to help them forward. 3. Captivity and exile among prophane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from enjoying the face of God, or the ſociety one of another in his Ordinances, is one of the Lords ſore judgements whereby he plagueth the ſins of his own Church; for, <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is carried to the land of Shinar.</hi> 4. As the Church is no place wherein reigning ſin will get a biding habitation: ſo a people that are enemies to the Church, are accounted in Gods ſight, as the common ſink of all wickedneſſe, whom therefore he will certainly puniſh: this is ſignified by the carrying of <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> out of the holy land, <hi>to the land of Shinar,</hi> as its own place, where all wickedneſſe dwelt: from which alſo the Jewes might aſſuredly gather, that as he had puniſhed them, ſo he would not ſpare their enemies.</p>

                  <p>In the viſion there are four warlike charets, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, at the Prophets deſire, to ſignifie <hi>the four ſpirits,</hi> or, <hi>windes of the heavens;</hi> whereby we may underſtand, either bands of Angels, (who are <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and as <hi>windes, Pſal.</hi> 104.4. and are repreſented by <hi>charets, Pſ.</hi> 68.17.) imployed at Gods direction to all the quarters of the world, and therefore called <hi>four;</hi> or, generally, all inſtruments acted by the Spirit or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, to do his will every where. The variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the charet-horſes, ſignifieth variety of diſpenſations, whether joyfull, ſad, or mixed, which are in Gods hands; the <hi>red</hi> portending calamities of warre and bloodſhed, the <hi>black,</hi> calamitie or deſtruction coming any other way then by the ſword, and the <hi>white,</hi> peace and proſperity, and the <hi>grizled</hi> and <hi>bay,</hi> a mixed diſpenſation of mercy and juſtice, though the <hi>bay</hi> may be rendered <hi>ſtrong,</hi> as a common property of all the charet-horſes. Theſe charets <hi>come forth from between two mountaines of braſſe,</hi> ſignifying the unchangeable decrees of God, which theſe inſtruments execute, and his firme provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by which they are ruled. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is an uſeful imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Church of God, to be much in ſtudying the Lords ſovereignty over the world, whereby it is ſubject to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſtrations: and that he hath competency of fit inſtruments whereby to execute his purpoſes, and to exerce his providence and ſovereignty in the earth; for, ſo much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Church in this viſion, wherein God is <hi>Lord of all the earth,</hi> hath inſtruments ſufficient for al the parts of the world, and theſe inſtruments, obſequious to receive directions, as <hi>ſtanding before the Lord,</hi> and nimble as <hi>ſpirit,</hi> or <hi>windes,</hi> and ſtrong as warlike <hi>charets</hi> to execute them. By ſtudying where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Church is taught, to exalt God, to ſtoop to him, to cleave to her duty having ſuch a Protector, and to be comforted in ſuch a portion as he is, whoſe preſence and train, for her behoofe, makes her famous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.16, 17. 2. It will contribute further to ſettle the mindes of Gods people, and make them to ſubmit to every diſpenſation, to ſtudy that all things are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world according to the pleaſure of God, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and purpoſes are, and ſhall be effectually executed in all the earth, and that his effectuall providence doth overrule all inſtruments, that nothing be done but what he hath decreed; This is alſo repreſented to the Church in this viſion, by the <hi>foure charets,</hi> (or inſtruments of God in all the parts of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169977:59"/>world) their <hi>coming out from between two mountaines of braſſe,</hi> that is, his unalterable counſels, which they are ſent forth to put in execution, and his effectual providence by which they are hemmed in on every hand, that they do nothing but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure. This ſtudie will lead the Church to ſee God in every diſpenſation, (which is comfortable when ſhe is reconciled to him,) and to ſee that no ill purpoſes of men can be effectual without him, and that none of his thoughts of peace will be hindered. 3. The counſels and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of God in governing the world, are deep and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, rather to be adored and read by the Church, according to the tenour of the Covenant, then pried into, till by his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and perfecting his work, ſhe be able to ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that which otherwiſe might readily be miſtaken; this is ſignified by the <hi>charets,</hi> coming out of ſome deep valley, <hi>between two mountaines,</hi> which is obſcure, and cannot eaſily be ſeen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 4. The Lord hath variety of diſpenſations, according as the condition of men (whether enemies, or the Church) calls for them, laid up in ſtore, and at his command to carve upon, and let out at his pleaſure without controulment; ſo that he is to be ſeen, and his wiſdom, fidelity, juſtice or mercy, &amp;c. to be adored in every one of them, according as they are let forth, and made beautiful in their time, and in reſpect of theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whom they are diſpenſed: this is ſignified by charet-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all colours, going forth at Gods direction. 5. As the ſtudy of the divine authority of the Word, and what is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, is that which the Church ought to be much about, in a time when ſhe hath her comforts to bring from thence; ſo in ſuch a time ſhe is to be much in dwelling upon the Word, and ſtirring up her ſelfe to underſtand the riches and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof: for, by this queſtion, ſo oft propounded, and here repeated by the Prophet, <hi>v.</hi> 4. we are taught both that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this viſion, or explication of it is invented by him, but all of God, and therefore to be leaned to; and alſo that for attaining the full comfort of the Scriptures, and of knowing Gods minde, lazineſſe would be ſhaken off, and God much employed for clearing it up unto us, being a depth not eaſily comprehended or taken up.</p>

Where Chriſt ſets up his Church in the world, he can when he pleaſeth induce men to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereunto, though it ſeem to bring much outward diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for, there are <hi>of the captivity which are come from</hi> Babylon, where many of theſe Jewes thought themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accommodated then to leave it for <hi>Judah.</hi> 2. The Lord is very tender of ſuch as are at any paines to ſeek him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ſpecial encouragement upon them, and commands all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to be uſed for that end; for, this great type, and the explication therof is for their encouragement, and the Prophet is to <hi>come the ſame day unto the houſe of Joſiah,</hi> or the place where <hi>he</hi> lodged, if he be one of the number. 3. None are to appear before the Lord empty, but when they come unto him in his Church, they are to give up themſelves, and what they have to be at his diſpoſing: this is ſignified by their bringing <hi>ſilver and gold,</hi> which the Prophet is to <hi>take of them.</hi> 4. Albeit our ſervices, and any thing we can offer to God, be of no worth before him, and may juſtly be rejected; yet ſuch is his graciouſneſſe that he may make more of our ſervices then we could well expect; for, not only are their gifts accepted, but made uſe of in contributing to this type, their ſilver and gold were the matter of the Crowns. 5. The Lord may employ perſons to ſuſtain extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as types, which it is not lawful for them to exerce in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ordinary way; for <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s getting two Crowns to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

Chriſt manifeſted in and to his Church, is an excellent and ſovereign encouragement, to invite men to come and joyne with her in how low an eſtate ſoever ſhe be; for, the ſubſtance of all this type, and the encouragement held out unto theſe ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to draw them and their brethren out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold, the man whoſe Name is the BRANCH.</hi> 2.

                     </gap>tion; but rather contributes much to their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that he came ſo near unto them, and was ſo like them in all things, and to his glory, that from ſo ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings he grew to ſo great an height; and makes his Church to flouriſh; therefore is he here deſcribed: <hi>The man whoſe Name is the BRANCH,</hi> or, <hi>tender bud,</hi> out of the root of <hi>Jeſſe, who ſhall grow up.</hi> 3. As Chriſt and his work are ſtill upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and growing hand till his body be perfected in glory; ſo his own arme and power is able to raiſe him up beyond all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, and without all humane help; for, <hi>he ſhall grow up out of his place,</hi> that is, out of <hi>Jeſſe</hi>'s withered root, when the glory of

There is great need of being much ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in the certainty of Chriſts carrying on of his own work, and that it depends on him only, whether meanes be or not; for this end is this promiſe again repeated; <hi>Even he ſhall build the Temple of the Lord.</hi> 2. All the glory and excellency of the Church is to be found in Chriſt, and however ſhe in her ſelf and in her officers may ſeem very vile; yet ſhe is raiſed up to glory in him, and all outward pompe that is wanting, is made up in him; this is ſignified by <hi>the two Crowns</hi> on <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s head, that however, both the Prieſthood and Princely dignity were now contemptible, yet he ſhould raiſe them to glory in his perſon: <hi>He ſhall bear the glory,</hi> though <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were in a baſe condition, and had little or no ſplendor. 3. The glory of rearing up and building a Church to God in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169977:62"/>world, is a burden too heavy for any but Chriſt to bear, and would cruſh any meane creature, however they be very ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of glory; this alſo is implied in that <hi>he ſhall build the Temple, and he ſhall bear the glory.</hi> 4. Chriſt alone is all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all the affaires of his Church, being inveſted with all offices that may contribute for her good, and appointed both King and Prieſt for her; for, <hi>he ſhall ſit and rule, and be a Prieſt upon his throne.</hi> 5. Chriſt as he is inveſted with power and authority, ſo he is not idle, but actively goes about all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which his offices engage him to; for, <hi>he rules, and is a Prieſt upon his throne.</hi> 6. Chriſt hath a ſtable poſſeſſion of all his offices and dignities, from which no oppoſition will remove him to the prejudice of his people, to leave them without an Head, a King or Prieſt; for, <hi>he ſhall ſit and rule, &amp;c.</hi> his ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting points out his ſtable and ſetled poſſeſſion. 7. Albeit Chriſt be inveſted with many and divers offices, yet conſidering that he is God all-ſufficient, none of them ſhall hinder another, nor ſhall he be overcharged with many employments toward parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſouls, his Church in general, or his enemies, but ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them on altogether, and particularly his Kingly and Prieſtly office, though very different, the one being for execution of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the other for obtaining mercy and pardon, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond particular explained in this type is, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the typical crowns of their offerings who came from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the crowning of <hi>Joſhua</hi> before them. After the crowns had been made uſe of on <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s head to repreſent Chriſt, they were to be laid up as a monument in the Temple for theſe men, not only to be a witneſſe of their liberality, or a token to confirme their faith of the promiſed Meſſiah, but as a pledge, that many both Jewes in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſtrangers, ſhould come from afar (as they did) and joyne in building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but eſpecially to make up a Church to God, ſome ſhadows whereof appeared afterward in ſtrangers adorning the Temple with their gifts, as now it was by their crowns, and in the help that they got from the Perſian Court, in ſending up their brethren under <hi>Ezra. Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords diſpenſations and manifeſtations toward his Church, ought to be of long and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during uſe unto her, and may contribute to many purpoſes if they be well ſtudied: therefore beſide the preſent uſe of theſe crowns, they are to be ſet up <hi>for a memorial in the Temple,</hi> to teach long after, and to be a pledge yet further, that <hi>they that are afar off ſhall come.</hi> 2. Such as in times of great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, do appear for ſtrengthening the hands of the Church, are ſingularly taken notice of, and may expect ſingular favours; for theſe men coming from <hi>Babylon</hi> with their offerings, in a time when the lingring of the Jewes there was the Churches grief, have this honour put upon them, that the Crowns ſhall <hi>be to them for a memorial,</hi> as a teſtimony of their zeal and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a pledge of the Meſſiahs coming, and of ſtrangers joyning to the Lord. 3. The hope of enlargement of the Church, is matter of great encouragement to the truly godly, and that God will bring theſe who are far off, lying by, or oppoſite to the work, to joyne in it when he pleaſeth, and will accept of them and their ſervice when they come: this is an encouragement to the Church of the Jewes; <hi>They that are far off ſhall come and build in the Temple:</hi> and may be ſtill an encouragement to them who are afar off, and have a minde to come 4. Such as come to joyne with Gods people are not to be idle and uſeleſſe, but to ſtudy in their ſtations to contribute ſomewhat for edifying and building up the body; for, they that come, <hi>muſt build in the Temple of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto this doctrine two things are ſubjoyned by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169977:63"/>1. That their own experience ſhould prove that Chriſt the Mediator was ſent to reveal theſe prophecies, and that the Prophet had authority to publiſh them, which was in part veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto them, by their getting help to the work, from theſe they little expected it of, and is now fully verified to the Church in after-ages, as their ſucceſſors. 2. That it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite on their part to be diligent, in obedience to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maods, if they would not be hinderers of the performance of promiſes, ſo far as they could, and would not deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of benefit by their accompliſhment. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever debates may ariſe in the mindes of Gods people, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of promiſes, yet experience and the event will put it out of all controverſie, that God is true: for, <hi>Ye ſhall know that the Lord of hoſtes hath ſent me,</hi> which may be underſtood of Chriſt ſent to reveal theſe things to the Prophet, or rather of the Prophet ſent to publiſh them to the Church in the Lords Name, as <hi>v.</hi> 9. 2. The Lords accompliſhing and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he hath foretold in his Word, ſhould lead his people back to a new and ſerious conſideration of the truth of it, that their confidence may reſt on it in new exigents, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for this is the uſe of what God doth, that we <hi>may know God hath ſent</hi> his Word by his ſervants, and learne to magnifie it as true. 3. Albeit the performance of the Lords abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be not ſuſpended upon mens doing of duty; yet neglect of duty may keep back the performance of many particular condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional promiſes, may juſtly be charged with impeding the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all promiſes to mens power, and doth alwayes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the comfort and fruit of performed promiſes from coming to the guilty man; for, ſaith he, <hi>This ſhall come to paſſe, if ye will diligently obey &amp;c.</hi> Not that the promiſe of Chriſts coming, and Converſion of the Gentiles depended on the Jewes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but that their neglect of duty would hinder mens preſent favouring of the work of the Temple, whom their ſins had made enemies of a long time, and that they did what they could, if they finned, to obſtruct all, and ſhould certainly have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by theſe ſpiritual promiſes. 4. The people of God are then accounted to make conſcience of their duty when they ſubmit to what God injoynes in his Word, however it ſuit with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; when they are careful to hear and ſeek out Gods minde in his Word, not ſhifting light; when they are diligent and active in endeavouring obedience, as becomes ſo great a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169977:64"/>Lord to be obeyed by his creatures, trembling leſt they be found out of the way, in a courſe of diſobedience, or ſleighting convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and contemning the light of information; and when all this obedience is performed, not as a cauſe of righteouſneſſe and juſtification, but as a fruit of faith, cloſing with God, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in Chriſt, and as a teſtimony of thankfulneſſe; for ſo is duty here deſcribed; <hi>If ye will diligently obey,</hi> (or <hi>hearken to</hi>) <hi>the voice of the Lord your God,</hi> which includes their abſolute ſubjection to the Word, their enquiring and hearkening to its directions, and both theſe with great diligence, and as a fruit of their being in Covenant with God.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Hitherto this Prophet hath been for moſt part employed in receiving and communicating to the Church ſeveral viſions: Now there followes a doctrinal Sermon, occaſioned by a caſe of conſcience propounded, whereof the riſe was thus: the people of the Jewes during their captivity obſerved divers yearly Faſts, in remembrance of their many deſolations, of which, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.19. one in the renth moneth, in remembrance of the beſieging of the city, which began in that moneth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.1. one in the fourth, becauſe the city was then taken, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.6. one in the ſeventh moneth, becauſe of the ſcattering of the remnant of the Jewes, when <hi>Gedaliah</hi> was ſlain, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.25. and one in the fifth moneth in remembrance of the burning of the Temple and City in that moneth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.8, 9. Now the City being again inhabited, and the work of the Temple far advanced (being two yeares ſince they had gone to work again, comparing <hi>v.</hi> 1. with <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.15.) two chief Ambaſſadours with their traine are ſent (belike from theſe in <hi>Babylon,</hi>) to worſhip God, and to propound the caſe to the Lords ordinary or extraordinary Miniſters; whether it were needful to continue that Faſt or not? <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However the Lord in his wiſdom may, when he pleaſes, forbear to employ extraordinary meanes and diſpenſations, even in the time when ſuch are in uſe, and leave his people to the uſe of ordinary meanes; yet upon new emergents he will not faile to appear as formerly: for here, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Zecharies</hi> firſt Sermon, containing the former viſions, which was in <hi>the ſecond yeare of Darius,</hi> chap. 1.7. we finde no more revelations, till <hi>the fourth yeare of King Darius;</hi> yet when this new caſe comes to be ſolved, <hi>the Word of the Lord came unto him.</hi> 2. To know the minde of God in our duty, is worthy of much pains, and matters of Religion ſhould be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as of very particular concernment to every one: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they think a ſolemne ambaſſage little enough to ſeek reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this queſtion; <hi>They ſent unto the houſe of God, Shere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer and Regem-melech with their men.</hi> And though they were more then one of them who came, and far more concerned in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169977:65"/>it, yet the queſtion is propounded as by every one in particular, <hi>Should I weep, &amp;c?</hi> 3. As matters of our duty may be oft-times very dark and unclear, for our humiliation, and up-ſtirring to make uſe of meanes; ſo it is not ſufficient that a perſon or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple employ God in their particular ſtrait, unleſſe in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe they be ſeekers of God: and ſuch as would have light from God, or his ſervants uſeful to them, would depend much on God, and be much in prayer to him; therefore are they ſent, by reaſon of this dark caſe, <hi>to pray before the Lord, and to ſpeak to the Prieſts, &amp;c.</hi> To teſtifie, that they were <hi>ſeekers</hi> of God, and of the ſame Religion with their brethren, and when they are to employ the Prieſts and Prophets for light; they begin at prayer to God. 4. Miniſters of the Word are bound to be able to reſolve the caſes of Gods people, not only in general doctrine, but in particular emergents and difficulties: for, <hi>the Prieſts and the Prophets are to be ſpoken to</hi> in this buſineſſe. 5. No means appointed of God for our help in difficulties, is to be neglected or vilipended by theſe who expect a bleſſing; for, they are to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> both to <hi>Prieſts and Prophets:</hi> both ordinary and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes (where they are) are to be uſed. 6. Solemn faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and humiliations, becauſe of Gods diſpleaſure, ought to have much inward ſenſe evidenced by ſeparation from outward delights, and mourning; for ſo the queſtion imports they had done, <hi>weeped</hi> and <hi>ſeparated themſelves:</hi> though that be not all required of an afflicted ſinful people, nor yet to make a Faſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, yet it is a part of the duty. 7. Whatever general inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be gathered from their propounding of this caſe, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our imitation; yet the queſtion, as propounded by them, is many wayes faulty, which ſerves alſo for our warning; as 1. There is a great deal of formality in ſending ſuch an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage about a ceremonie, when yet they neglected the ſubſtance of Religion; Formality may make great ſhew of little, and moſt noiſe about that which is to leaſt purpoſe. 2. Much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief appears here; for, in that they enquire about omitting this Faſt only, they inſinuate that they doubted of removing their other calamities, for which they faſted alſo, (as we will heare afterward,) and ſo go no further then their ſenſe; yea, in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning about this ſame, they inſinuate their doubting that the Temple ſhould be perfected. Unbelief will receive or expect no more then it ſeeth, and ſo breeds us much vexing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. 3. Much oftentation that they had done it ſo long, for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169977:65"/>ſo many yeares, which now they look upon as ſomewhat when the work is going on; when the Lord bleſſeth any work that we have been uſing endeavours about, our hearts are then very ready to think much of our doing. 4. Much unſafe walking having no ground of their doubt, but their old cuſtome, <hi>Shall I weep as I have done theſe ſo many yeares?</hi> how ſmall ground and warrant ſoever there was of this their faſting, yet many have no better then cuſtome and education, for their ground in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Religion, which makes very unſure work. 5. That they now think of laying aſide this duty, (whatever warrant they had for it, of which they do not doubt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Lord ſends out his Prophet to declare his minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this queſtion, not only to theſe who propounded it, but unto all the people of the land, and the Prieſts alſo. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he give a full anſwer to this queſtion to their contentment, he premits in this chapter ſomewhat by way of reproof of their way. And firſt, he reproves their way, not only in this Faſt, but in all the reſt, (whereof he names one,) as being faultie in that it was not done to God. Whereby we are to underſtand, partly that they were of their own appointment, and not enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, it not being lawful forthem to appoint ſuch dayes for faſting, unleſſe the Prophets amongſt them had in Gods Name appointed and allowed of theſe Faſts, of which we reade not: For however all theſe calamities did call them to faſting and weeping, and Gods impoſing the neceſſity by his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169977:66"/>did warrant them to ſet apart ſome time for that purpoſe; and however they might agree to do ſo from time to time, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time it was revealed by God, that their captivity ſhould continue: yet it was not lawful for them to fixe ſuch anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dayes by dedication, or conſecration, and ſanctification, as making it unlawful to take that day again for worldly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, if providence ſo called, or unlawful to do worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, if called to them on that day, even as the work of their calling at that time, whereas works of neceſſity are to be done on the Sabbath with a Sabbath-dayes heart; or as if the ſervice were more acceptably performed on that day then on another: as they choſe the very dayes of their greateſt calamities for their Faſts, as if the time ſhould have influence on the work. All theſe are to encroach upon the Prerogative of God, and far leſſe is it now lawful to fix ſuch anniverſary dayes, either for faſting or thankſgiving: ſeeing that (beſide the want of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo to do) we have not ſuch certainty what our future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhall be, as they had during the ſeventy yeares captivity, and know not but providence may call us to rejoyce, when our time is to weep; and to weep when our time is to rejoyce; and ſo it belongs to God only to fixe times for ſuch duties, whoſe providence can make our condition ſuitable to the duty of the time. But beſide this defect, the Lords reproof doth alſo ſtrike at the manner of their performing theſe Faſts, as being done in ſuch a way (whatever warrant there were for them) as could not be acceptable to him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord ſpeaks his minde unto his people, and eſpecially againſt their formal, and inveterate cuſtomes, it is needful to take him up in his abſolute dominion and omnipotency, as being able to cruſh them who contemn his Word, and to make them happy who follow his way, whatever it ſeem to promiſe in it ſelf: therefore is this meſſage called <hi>the Word of the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 2. The Word of God, and the doctrine therein contained, concerning our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is of general concernment unto all, however many times only few are ſenſible of their need of it: for this cauſe it is, that the anſwer is not given only to theſe who enquired, but <hi>to all the people of the Land,</hi> as being a doctrine of general uſe to all, 3. Such as ought to be inſtructers of others, may oft-times turne as far aſide, and need inſtruction as much as any; for, the very <hi>Prieſts</hi> who were enquired concerning this caſe, <hi>v.</hi> 3. are to be ſpoken to and taught, and ſo the Church had been in a

The Lord accepts no ſervice, how glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous-like ſoever, as done to him, that is not commanded and enjoyned by himſelf; for, ſaith he of theſe Faſts of their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Did ye at all faſt to me, even to me?</hi> even albeit they both <hi>faſted and mourned.</hi> A will-worſhipper fancies a god in his own imagination, to accept his ſervice, who is not the God who hath revealed himſelf in his Word; or at beſt is a miſtaken God. 5. The excellencie and worth of our ſervice, and our happineſſe thereby, doth not conſiſt in what meaſure of performance we can attaine unto, but in Gods accepting of it as ſervice through Chriſt, which we are chiefly to look unto, and have a care of, and not to be diſcouraged with mean endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, if he reſpect them, nor puffed up with faireſt flouriſhes, while that is wanting, ſo much is implied in that doubled queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Did ye it to me, even to me?</hi> 6. As humility is a ſure ſymptome of one who ſerves God in a right manner; ſo it may humble us in performances before the Lord, to conſider that our ſervices cannot profit him, nor is he obliged to us for them, otherwiſe then by free grace: ſo much alſo is imported in this queſtion; for in oppoſition to their oſtentation in propounding their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the Lord layes them low by telling them it was not done to him, all the profit (if there were any) would be their own. 7. Days of faſting and humiliation, with never ſo much ſenſe and feeling, can never be acceptable to God, ſo long as only the ſenſe of our own calamities ſets us on work, and we reſt there without attaining to ſenſe of ſin, and minding to turn to God; this is another fault reprehended in their faſting; <hi>Did ye at all faſt unto me?</hi> had ye any ſenſe of the injuries done to me, or purpoſe to amend them? was it not becauſe of your own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ye faſted and mourned? 8. Men do for moſt part miſtake or remain ignorant of their own condition, and careleſſe of what the Lords ſervants ſay, through want of ſerious examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own conſcience. A tender, active and well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed conſcience would ſhew much, as the Lords ſervants do ſay; therefore the Lord appeales to their own conſciences in this queſtion, as able to ſolve the doubt, and plead for him, if it were put to it; <hi>Did ye faſt unto me?</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond fault which the Lord finds with their way is, that they were taken up with theſe obſervations, but neglected that which was ſubſtantial.

The Lord in all ages is uniforme and like himſelf, in approving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of duty, and in diſliking of ſin, yeſterday, and to day, the ſame for ever; for, the Lord here requires the ſame he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of their fathers; <hi>Should ye not heare the words which the Lord hath cried by the former Prophets?</hi> 3. The longer the Lord by his Word hath been preſſing duty upon his people, they ought to heed it the more, leſt judgement prove the ſadder; for, he preſſeth a doctrine that had been long ſince cried, to be ſo much the rather heard. 4 The Lords chaſtiling a people for ſin and diſobedience, doth not warrant them to look on their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the chaſtiſement, as a full aſſurance of their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, as if their ſtroaks had made up all but being delivered they are to make conſcience of obedience, otherwiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ſtill ſtands, whatever deliverance they get, and they may expect to ſmart again.

                  <p>To clear further this laſt challenge, and to juſtifie the Lords way in all that came on this people, and teach them how to compoſe the controverſie: The Prophet <hi>Zecharie</hi> gets a commiſſion to clear the whole procedure betwixt God and their fathers, for them to make uſe of, and not leane to their Faſts: and firſt, by repeating the doctrine of the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to their fathers, (which ſtandeth yet in force to oblige their children, and therefore as God <hi>ſpake</hi> it, ſo he yet <hi>ſpeaketh</hi> it,) he cleares that God had required of their fathers, that they would prove their faith and ſincerity in the true Religion, by the exerciſe of juſtice and mercy toward all, eſpecially the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; and that both in actions and inclinations, as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſecond Table. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord hath let forth his diſpleaſure againſt a people, it concernes them who are reſerved to be well informed in the proceeding and cauſes of it, that they may lay it to heart, and know how to make their peace: therefore doth <hi>Zecharie</hi> get a new Commiſſion, to repeat this unto them, which had been ſaid and ſpoken ta their fathers; <hi>The Word of the Lord came to Zechariah, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, &amp;c.</hi> or, thus <hi>he ſpake</hi> to them, and thus <hi>he ſpeaketh</hi> to you, the word will import both. 2. Obedience to God in the duties of the ſecond Table, is the true touch-ſtone whereby to try ſincerity in Religion, and obedience in duties of the firſt Table; this was it by which God tried his Church in all ages; <hi>Execute true judgement, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Our doing of things required of us in point of juſtice is no ſuch proof of ſincerity, unleſſe acts of tenderneſſe and affection, enjoyned by charity, be made conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of likewiſe; therefore they are conjoyned here: <hi>Execute
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169977:68"/>true judgement, and ſhew mercy and compaſſions every man to his brother.</hi> 4. For right performance of works of juſtice and mercy, it is requiſite that we put on affection one to another, as coming of one root, whatever difference there be in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpenſations: and eſpecially to men of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as being tied to them in more near relation: therefore are they deſigned toward whom we are to walk in theſe duties, as brethren: <hi>Shew mercy every man to his brother.</hi> 5. It is a ſpecial proof of an heart ſubjected to God, and his feare, and filled with true love to our neighbour, when one is bound up from wronging of the afflicted, or taking advantage of their low condition to run over them, and when conſcience makes a man tender and ſenſible of their affliction, and as afraid to do them wrong, as if they were a ſtrong party, able to repay inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſo is here required: <hi>Oppreſſe not the widow, nor the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, the ſtranger, nor the poor.</hi> 6.

                  <p>In the next place, the Prophet at Gods command, gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had been their fathers part in reference to theſe duties: when God thus exhorted them, they obſtinately rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, refuſing to hearken, deſpiſing to take on the yoke of his obedience, yea, ſtopping their own care, and hardening their heart, againſt the commands, or conviction for the contempt thereof, to the grieving of the Spirit who ſpake in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the duty of men to heare when God ſpeaks to them, and to take on what yoke he impoſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, how grievous ſoever it be to fleſh and blood; for, it was their great fault, that <hi>they refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder,</hi> as an undantoned beaſt from the yoke. 2. Men by nature are very high-bended againſt God, and againſt being ſubject unto him, and have an antipathy againſt holineſſe, and the way which the Word preſcribes unto them to follow; ſo is imported in their <hi>refuſing to hearken, pulling away the ſhoulder:</hi> and in their guarding care and heart, leſt the Word ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with them, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4, 5. 3. As diſobedient ſinners, living under the Miniſtery of the Word, cannot but be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome convictions troubling them, unleſſe they be given over to a reprobate ſenſe: ſo it is a dreadful character when they ſhift convictions, and make it all their ſtudie how to ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance; for ſo did theſe, <hi>They ſtopped their eares, that they ſhould not hear.</hi> 4. So long as the Word heard doth any way affect a ſinner, there is ſome hope of him, how rebellious or ſhifting ſoever he be; but the moſt deſperate and lamentable temper is, when ſinners have ſo far put out the light of their own minde, blunted the edge of their conſcience, deaded their affections, and confirmed their hearts in ſin, that they can go on boldly, and without remorſe, heare what they will: this is the height of ſpiritual plagues; <hi>Yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant, leſt they ſhould hear, &amp;c.</hi> 5. They are the moſt ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and obdured of all ſinners, who living under the Word, have learned to contemn it, who have blinded themſelves by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing clear light, and who have ſinfully hardened their owne hearts, and added to their natural obduration by deſpiſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſleighting and rejecting of convictions and challenges; Such, not only <hi>ſtop their cares,</hi> but <hi>make their hearts as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant ſtone,</hi> which is the hardeſt of ſtones. 6. The ſin of diſobedience unto the Word, is an oppoſition not unto men, but unto the Spirit of God who employes them, and ſpeaks by
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169977:69"/>them; who though in his ſpecial operations of grace he works effectually and invincibly: yet in his perſwaſions by the Word, working as a moral agent, is oft-times reſiſted and oppoſed, for ſuch is their ſin here, they would not heare the Law, <hi>which the Lord of hoſtes ſent in his Spirit by the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> See, Acts 7.51. Iſa. 63.10.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, the Prophet gives an account of Gods juſt procedure, in puniſhing this their carriage: as they provoked the Lord exceedingly to anger, ſo he let it break forth upon them in ſad judgements, under which he (juſtly recompencing their rebellion) would not bear them to deliver them; and did ſuddenly and violently caſt them out of their land, and ſcatter them among ſtrangers, as chaffe before a whirlwinde, and laid their land deſolate, which was to be charged upon their ſins, which had polluted it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Contempt of, and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Word, doth provoke God to hot, and more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſpleaſure, which will break forth irreſiſtibly when the iniquity is come to the height, as being the diſpleaſure of an Omnipotent Lord; for, <hi>Therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 2. As God can make the ſtouteſt hearted ſinner, who cares leaſt for him, ſtand ſenſibly in need of his help, when he pleaſeth; inſomuch that a favourable look of God, and his interpoſing will be his only refuge; ſo it is juſt with God to recompence his contempt of Gods Word, with not regarding his cry in his ſtrait; and when the Lord ſeems not to beate prayer in trouble, he calls us thereby to lay to heart, and be humbled for our not hearkening to his Word: for, <hi>Therefore it came to paſſe, that as I cried, and they would not hear, ſo they cried, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 3. Gods purſuing a controverſie againſt his Church, makes enemies endeavours ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeful and dreadful, and her oppoſition in vain; for, <hi>I ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them with a whirlewinde,</hi> which cannot be reſiſted. 4. It is a fore judgement, and the fruit of contempt of the Word and Ordinances, when the people of God are ſcattered from the fellowſhip one of another, and caſt among ſtrangers, with whom they can have no communion, eſpecially in Ordinances; <hi>I ſcattered them among all the Nations whom they knew not.</hi> 5. It is no ſmall addition to a judgement, or aggravation of guilt, to conſider the deſolation that ſin brings upon a land for the ſinners ſake; eſpecially upon a land wherein God hath dwelt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169977:70"/>which is the only beauty of a land, able to ſupply the want of all other pleaſure; for, <hi>Thus the land,</hi> even <hi>the pleaſant land was deſolate.</hi> 6. Albeit all calamities for ſin are to be aſcribed unto God, as the author and inflicter thereof in juſtice; yet guilty ſinners procuring the ſtroak, are to look on it as their deed, and themſelves as juſtly charged with all that a land, the Church, or others ſuffer: for, <hi>They laid the pleaſant land deſolate.</hi> 7. The tenderneſſe of God toward his people is ſuch, as in greateſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he ſtill doth ſomewhat that ſpeaks ground of hope of future mercy: for, <hi>the lands being deſolate after them, that no man paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through or returned,</hi> was not only a judgement for ſin, but a mercy, that during their captivity no Nation about did ſit down and poſſeſſe their land, but it was left void till they ſhould return to it, and have none to contend with them for poſſeſſion.</p>

                  <p>In this Chapter, the Lord goes on in anſwering that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propounded concerning their faſting, as appears, <hi>v.</hi> 19. and as the Lord found much to be reproved in their way in the former Chapter: ſo alſo, conſidering that theſe queſtions flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in part from their diſcouragement, and doubtfulneſſe how matters would ſucceed; therefore he ſubjoyns unto the reproof ſeveral grounds of encouragement unto them, whereof the firſt is taken from his marriage-affection toward them, as they might reade in what he had done of late, his deſtroying of <hi>Babel,</hi> and delivering them, being an unqueſtionable evidence of his love toward them, and of his indignation toward their enemies. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord is moſt ſeverely reproving his people for ſin, it is not his purpoſe to drive any ſenſible ſoul into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, but he allowes them to ſtrengthen themſelves that challenges may work the better; therefore is this doctrine ſubjoyned to the former, leſt they ſhould miſtake his ſcope and purpoſe in it. 2. The authority of God ſpeaking in his Word, is to be much and often thought upon by all ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the benefit of Scripture-comforts; therefore albeit this be but a part of the former Sermon, yet it is found neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Prophets Commiſſion; <hi>The Word of the Lord of hoſtes came unto me,</hi> in regard that many promiſes here made, could only be aſſured to them from his being God; and for this end is he ſo oft brought in ſpeaking in all the Chapter. 3. The fountain of the Churches encouragement, is in Gods free love and marriage-affection, which as it doth not break off in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo will it be very ſevere in avenging injuries done to ſuch as are beloved of him; for ſo is here held forth: <hi>I was jealous for Zion with great jealouſie, and I was jealous for her with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:169977:71"/>great fury.</hi> His <hi>jealouſie</hi> proves he is married, his <hi>fury</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies how much he reſents their affliction, and both theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to comfort her. 4. The Lord hath at all times prevented his Church and people, with ſuch manifeſtations of himſelf, as may be abundant proof of his affection toward them; and ground of encouragement for the time to come: therefore he leads this people back to what had been done, eſpecially in their late deliverance, to clear this truth, and encourage them for the future; <hi>I was jealous, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond ground of encouragement is, that God was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to them again, would dwell among them as of old, and reſtore them to the dignity and priviledges they formerly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords being reconciled unto a people, and their enjoying his favour, is a ſpecial ground of their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, eſpecially that after juſt wrath he will deigne them with mercy, and be at paines to make up the friendſhip; for, thus he encourageth them; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I am returned to Zion.</hi> 2 When the Lord is reconciled unto his people, he will manifeſt his preſence unto them, and be as near and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to help every grievance, as the heart is to ſupply every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for, <hi>I will dwell in the midſt of Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaith he 3. Reconciliation with God, is the way to recover a peoples loſt honour and priviledges, and to make them enjoy them and the comfort of them; for, upon his returning look what made her eminent before, and it ſhall be reſtored. She ſhall be called by her old names, which is not a promiſe of a bare tittle only, but that ſhe ſhall be eminent in her duty, and the priviledges and mercies following thereupon, ſhall be as viſible as if they were her name. 4. It is the great honour of a people, to enjoy, and ſincerely to adhere unto and profeſſe the truth of God, as he hath revealed it in his Word: to adorne that Profeſſion with fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and uprighteneſs in matters of the ſecond Table; and to be

To have relation unto God, and be owned as his, ſpeaks much honour to a people, that he, unto whom all things belong, ſhould appropriate them unto himſelf, as a peculiar lot, to be cared for in an eſpecial way: this honour is imported in that name, <hi>the mountain of the Lord of hoſter.</hi> 6. As holineſſe beſeemeth a people who are the Lords; ſo it is their ſpecial honour and dignity to be ſuch, and a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the truth they profeſſe when they hold a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with it: for, this mountain <hi>ſhall be called the holy mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine.</hi>

The encreaſe of a people, (eſpecially ſuch as are members of the Church,) and peaceable times with the common refreſhments thereof, in living to old age, want of terrour, not being cut off by violent deaths, childrens recreations, and growing up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of enemies, &amp;c. are in their own kinde, choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to be acknowledged where they are, and to be a cauſe of humiliation where they are wanting: for, the promiſe of this is a ground of encouragement here. See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.62, 63, 64. and 144.11,—15.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169977:72"/>2. A people reconciled to God, and adhering to the true ſpiritual priviledges of Gods preſence, ſhall enjoy as much outward proſperity as is for their good; for this promiſe is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the former, as a fruit of them.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>In regard theſe promiſes might ſeem improbable and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be performed, conſidering that the Jewes were at that time but a deſpicable remnant, and the times full of dangers and feares; the Lord removes all difficulties, by leading them to look on him to whom nothing is impoſſible. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As faith is very neceſſary for honouring of God, and our owne comfort in receiving his promiſes; ſo it is no ſmall difficulty to attain to it. Things promiſed may ſeem very impoſſible, not only to carnal men, but ſometimes even to the Lords people; for, this confirmation of the former doctrine ſhewes, that he expects faith to cloſe with what he ſaith; and its being <hi>marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> or <hi>hid</hi> (a thing which they cannot ſee through as feaſible or poſſible) ſhewes their temper. 2. The fountain of much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief is, mens looking to themſelves and their preſent hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and receiving no more truth then reaſon and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, thus pre-occupied, will convince them of; for, this is marvellous, becauſe they looked on themſelves, as <hi>the remnant of the people,</hi> and on <hi>theſe dayes</hi> as hard dayes. 3. The way to attain to faith in hard and difficult times is, to eye God who makes the promiſe, and give him the glory of being God, of faithfulneſſe in promiſing, and Omnipotency to perform and overcome impoſſibilities, whatever we be: for he refutes their unbelief by leading them from themſelves to eye him: <hi>The Lord of hoſtes, in whoſe eyes it is not marvellous.</hi> 4 A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple taking up God rightly, will, themſelves being Judges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend, that it is a wronging of God to lay any thing in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his power as able to over-balance it, or to diſtruſt his promiſes, whatever they ſee in the world or their own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to render them improbable: for, in this he appeals to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

                  </q>
                  <p>The fourth ground of encouragement, (which alſo cleareth the promiſe of their increaſe) is, that he will gather them from all parts of the world, where they were ſcattered, (comprehended under Eaſt and Weſt, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.3. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.1.) and bring them to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judea,</hi> and renew the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them: which was verified at ſeveral times after this Prophecie till Chriſt came, beſide what further accompliſhment of it may be reſerved till <hi>Iſraels</hi> Converſion. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as are following their duty, though with much heſitation and diſcouragement, becauſe of the averſeneſſe of others leaving them alone in it, may expect confirmation from God, and that in due time, (if it be for their good) ſuch as have weakened their hands ſhall joyne and ſtrengthen them; for, this promiſe of the gathering of Gods people is given to encourage them, who by reaſon of their paucity, and the difficulties they met with, were ready to think they were come too ſoon home. 2. Intereſt in God will bring a people out of a low condition, and gather them after a ſad ſcattering; for, <hi>Behold, I will ſave my people from the Eaſt-countrey, and from the Weſt-countrey, and will bring them, and they ſhall dwell in the midſt of Jeruſalem.</hi> 3. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular favours and deliverances are then comfortable to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when the Lord either makes or renewes a Covenant with them, giving himſelf unto them with theſe favours, aſſuring them that old kindneſſe ſtands yet firme, and undertaking for their part, to make them ſuch as he will accept of, and may continue theſe bleſſings with; therefore is the renewing of the Covenant ſubjoyned, wherein God undertakes for both parties, <hi>And they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</hi> 4. Where God enters into a Covenant with his people, he intends really to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169977:73"/>perform all that he engages to do, without all diſſimulation, ſo that it may be truſted to as a portion; for, this Covenant is in <hi>truth.</hi> 5. The ſure foundation of the Churches comfort by a Covenant, is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, whereby ſhe is made able to ſtand before God: and the right way to confirme her of her intereſt therein, is a ſtudy of righteous and upright walking before him: both theſe are implled in that ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that the Covenant ſhall be <hi>in righteouſneſſe.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe encouragements being publiſhed, the Lord exhorts them to make uſe of them, in chearful going about the work of building the Temple, to which alſo are ſubjoyned further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and encouragements. And firſt, that they are exhorted to it by theſe Prophets, who theſe two yeares ſince they began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to work, had encouraged them unto it, and not only aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that it would be perfected, but had foretold other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which had come to paſſe, as is after-cleared. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As encouragements from God are to be made uſe of, to make us faithful to him, and in his work: and as the work of God would be followed with much faith and alacrity, ſo men have ordinarily many tentations to be diſcouraged, from within and without, which they are to wraſtle againſt and employ God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſo much is implied in this exhortation ſubjoyned to the former doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This motive is yet further cleared from the bleſſings that had come upon them ſince they began to build, according to the predictions of theſe Prophets when they exhorted them to it: for, whereas before they began the work all went to ruine, there being no ſucceſſe of endeavours of man or beaſt, no peace by reaſon of hoſtile incurſions and civil diſcords, <hi>v.</hi> 10. now their condition was changed, according to what the Prophets had foretold, and was to be yet changed to greater felicity, (for, <hi>v.</hi> 11. which is in the Hebrew, <hi>But now I not unto the refidue, &amp;c.</hi> doth include both <hi>I am not</hi> for the preſent, not <hi>will be</hi> for the future, <hi>as in the former dayes.</hi>) And particularly he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to bleſſe the increaſe of the earth, and give unto them though a remnant, the peaceable enjoyment thereof. And therefore they were to give credit to the ſame men, promiſing by the ſame authority the ſucceſſe of the work. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proofes of the truth of Gods Word in the mouth of his ſervants, ought to be a ſpecial motive to faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in other things, which they enjoyne and promiſe in the Lords Name, and by his warrant; for, by this ſeen accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:169977:74"/>of the Word, they are invited to build and believe the ſucceſſe. 2.

When the Lord is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſſe, by word or work, his people would take heed that they do not undervalue it, by continuing in diſcouragement, but are to honour him by being ſtrengthened and comforted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: and in this eſpecially they are to guard againſt their owne fearful and fainting hearts, which will make diſcouragements where there are none: and which being ſupported, will make that no outward diſpenſations ſhall diſcourage; therefore are they again exhorted, <hi>Feare not, but let your hands be ſtrong.</hi>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169977:75"/>they had found in former threatenings; for, as the Lord had exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted threatenings for their ſins, and that nowithſtanding all their thoughts, that he would revoke his ſentence, and not ſee their laſt end: ſo had he now as unchangeable a purpoſe to bleſſe them, and to perform theſe promiſes, and therefore they were, contrary to all their doubes and feares, to believe, he being as unchangeable in the one, as in the other, and withal a God that delights in mercy. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

It's the ordinary weakneſſe and diſtemper of the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they are moſt ready to doubt that which they are moſt called to believe, and to believe that for which they have no ground; for, this people could not believe any thing but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>when God thought to juniſh them,</hi> and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>

The diſappointments our misbelieving hearts have had, (whether in execution of promiſes or threatenings) ought to be an argument for perſwading us to believe what is revealed in new exigents; therefore he layeth before them how far judgements had come beyond their expectation, that they might learne not to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure promiſes by their apprehenſions. 4. The Lords afflicted people need not want a confirmation of Gods fidelity in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo long as the ſtroaks on them prove his truth in threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his ſtriking according to his threatening when they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, is a pledge, and may be a ground of hope, that he will perform his Word of promiſe when they need it: for, by ſuch an argument doth the Lord confirm theſe fainters here. See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.42. 5. As the Lord doth not ſtrike his people without pity, but upon juſt provocation given, which it concernes him in his glory and reſpect to them not to paſſe over: So any good that comes to them, ariſes freely from his own purpoſe of love, and that is to be reſted on for it: for in the one it is, <hi>I thought to puniſh you when your fathers provoked me to wrath;</hi> in the other, <hi>So again in theſe dayes have I thought to do well, &amp;c.</hi>

It is the great honour of a people to enjoy the true Religion, and to be inſtrumental in doing good to others, and ſuch will be honoured of all who know God: for, this is the honour of a Jew, that <hi>his skirt is taken hold of</hi> by the Gentiles, becauſe that <hi>God is with him,</hi> and thus do the Convert Gentiles honour them. 4.

On the other hand, it is clear from hiſtories, that all theſe cities here mentioned were deſtroyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Grecian Monarchy, betwixt this Prophecie, and the coming of Chriſt, of which, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and theſe words in this verſe formerly mentioned, may alſo be thus read; <hi>For the Lords is the eye of man, and of all the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> that is, the providence of God, (which is his eye upon man, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.9. and 5.6.) is over all Nations as well as his people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will take notice of their faults and puniſh them, as well as his <hi>Iſrael.</hi> In this difficulty it ſufficeth us, 1. That the ſenſe of the particular predictions is clear, whatever time we referred them to. 2. That the Lords ſcope in them is alſo clear, which is to encourage the preſent Church, and ſtrengthen her for her duty: for which end it is not unuſual for God in one predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to point at ſomewhat near to be accompliſhed, and yet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that but as a pledge of ſomewhat further off, and ſo both theſe may come in under one prediction, ſomewhat to be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen by the Jewes, and that pointing at ſomewhat to be done long after. 3. That the ſenſe of both theſe tranſlations of the cloſe of the verſe, concur in Gods executing of vengeance on enemies: for he doth puniſh them, becauſe his providence is not confined to his Church, but is exerced over all the world, in obſerving the wayes of all men (as well as of his people) and recompencing them accordingly, and therefore he will not ſpare them more then his own people; and the time of his doing of it, is, when his people, whom he avengeth, have their eyes and hearts toward him. 4 That it is clear and certain there is a time coming, wherein the eyes of the fulneſſe of the Gentiles,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169977:79"/>and of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be toward the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. at which time the Lords accompliſhment will expound many dark pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, concerning <hi>Iraels</hi> reſtitution to their land, and victory over their enemies: for unto this, many things in this and the following chapters ſeem ſo clearly to point, that whatever was literally performed to the Jewes, was but a taſte of the fulneſſe of the prediction: and whatever be done to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Spirit in a ſpiritual way, yet the prediction in its full and literal ſenſe ſeems to look another way.</p>
                  <p>Having premitted this as a neceſſary Introduction, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this part of the chapter, but to the whole enſuing prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: I ſhall ſo go through particulars, as chiefly to gather ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral inſtructions, without relation to particular times, yet not omitting to point at the ſeveral paſſages, which ſpeaks moſt clearly to <hi>Iſraels</hi> converſion and reſtitution. And ſo, the firſt place threatened with this burdenſom meſſage is, the Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi> called the land of <hi>Hadrach,</hi> from the name of ſome of their idols, (as <hi>Judea</hi> is called <hi>Immanuels land,</hi> Iſa. 8.8. So alſo the Moabites are named by their idols, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.46.) or from ſome part in <hi>Syria</hi> called by this name. And particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> (the chief City of <hi>Syria, Iſa</hi> 7.8.) is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, that this vengeance ſhould dwell on it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Word of the Lord, how light ſoever it ſeem, yet in the end will prove inſupportable and cruſhing to theſe againſt whom it ſpeaks bitter things; for, a threatening is, <hi>The burden of the Word of the Lord.</hi> 2 As the Lords providence is univerſal; ſo enemies ſhall not eſcape his hands in due time; for, the Lord (who hath an eye upon man, and all <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) hath a burdenſom word, <hi>in the land of Hadracb.</hi> 3. As eminent places in a land enjoy moſt of the mercies, and ordinarily have moſt acceſſion and greateſt ſhare in the ſins of the land; ſo ſad judgements or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily afflict them moſt: therefore <hi>Damaſcus</hi> the chief City is ſpecially threatened. 4. Gods judgements upon wicked men, and eſpecially enemies to his Church, do not come with a light touch, but they lie ſad, and are permanent upon them; for, <hi>Damaſcus ſhall be the reſt</hi> of this burdenſome word. 5. It is a clear evidence of approaching judgement on the wicked, when the Lords people turn unto him, and make their peace with him through Chriſt, and are kept in humble dependance on him, for expeding them out of their difficulties; for, ſo do the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169977:79"/>words hold out as they are in the tranſlation; This ſhall be <hi>when the eyes of man, and of all the tribes of Iſrael ſhall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Lord,</hi> and is agreeable to other Scriptures, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.9. and elſewhere: and we are to long for the performance of this to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that it may make way for bringing down of enemies.</p>

The Lord hath the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of judgements wholly at his diſpoſal, to ſend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he will, and in what meaſure he will; for, ſo are we taught here; he diſpoſeth of the burden here and there, <hi>And Hamath alſo ſhall border thereby, Tyrus and Zidon, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is a judgement on many people, when God is to plague them, that they are puffed up and ſecure, becauſe of carnal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and confidences; for, <hi>Trrus is very wiſe,</hi> ſtrongly ſituate and rich, whereby they think they are ſecured. 3.

                  </q>
                  <p>The judgement comes further on againſt the Philiſtines the inveterate enemies of the Jewes: ſome of whoſe cities, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all,) are threatened with terrour at the ſight of <hi>Tyrus</hi> fall, in reſpect they expected that its impregnableneſſe ſhould ſtop the enemies proceeding: and are further threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with overturning their State and Government with the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of their countrey, and its being poſſeſſed with ſtrangers, or a mixture of vile men, as baſe, and having as little right to it, as baſtards have to an inheritance. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The terrour of God is an ordinary fore-runner of vengeance, and a ſore partie to the ſtouteſt; for, <hi>Aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>kelon ſhall ſee it and feare.</hi> 2. It is a judgement on wicked men, that they get not the right uſe of calamities on others; for, when they ſhould repent and turne to God, they <hi>feare.</hi> 3. Whatever it be beſide God, that men in an ill time put confidence in, it will produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but feare, ſorrow and confuſion; for, ſo was <hi>Tyrus</hi> to the Philiſtines; they <hi>ſee and feare, and be very ſorrowfull, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169977:80"/>their expectation is aſhamed.</hi> 4. Gods having a controverſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a people, how flouriſhing ſoever, is ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne their government, diſpeople their Countrey, and put it in the poſſeſſion of forreigners; for, the burden ſome word makes that <hi>The King</hi> (or government, which was managed in every city by a ſupream Lord, 1 <hi>Saw.</hi> 5.11. and elſewhere) <hi>ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh from Gaza, and Aſhkelon ſhall not be inhabited: and a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſhall dwell in Aſhdod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This judgement on the Philiſtines is amplified from two effects, that by this calamity, the Lord ſhould revenge and lay their pride, and ſhould puniſh their cruel and abominable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and preying on his people. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Pride and inſolency in proſperity, is a certaine preſage of ruine, and an evil which God will be ſeen in bringing down, and ſtripping the ſinners of all wherein they gloried; for, by thus ruining them, <hi>I will cut off the pride of the Philiſtimes,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 2. As oppreſſion is the fruit of pride, ſo it is ſo beaſtly like and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable a ſinne before the Lord, that he will manifeſt himſelfe eminently, before it be not puniſhed, and hindred of its courſe; therefore the Lord ſpeaks of it as a beaſtly ſinne, which himſelfe will puniſh; <hi>I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abomination from between his teeth.</hi> 3. It is a token of very great perverſneſſe in a people; and of very great diſpleaſure from the Lord, when there is no end put to their ſinning but by their deſtruction; for, thus is it with the Philiſtines, it is by their ruine that their pride is cut off, and their blood taken away.</p>
                  <p>Unto this threatened judgement on enemies round about, a twofold encouragement to the Church is ſubjoyned: whereof the firſt (in the end of <hi>v.</hi> 7.) is, that ſhe ſhould increaſe by the ruine of her enemies, the remainders of whom, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and entered into Covenant with God, and be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the Churches affaires, and eminent in her, as if they were governours of <hi>Judah,</hi> and particularly the Philiſtines and Ekro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites ſhould be converted and dwell in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as the Jebuſites did of old, who had a Fort in it, till <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. or as <hi>Araunab</hi> the Jebuſite. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Church of God is no loſer by all the commotions of the world, he mindes her profit and riſing, in the ruine of others: for, he will ruine many Nations, if it were but to gather a few precious ſtones to advance her ſtructure, <hi>But he that remaineth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169977:81"/>ſhall be for our God.</hi> 2. As theſe who are reſerved in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ought to be drawn to God eſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo preſervation may give ground of hope, that God intends much good to them who improve it well; for, <hi>He that remaineth, even he</hi> (how low ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or, how great an enemy ſoever he hath been) <hi>ſhall be for our God.</hi> 3. It is a great token of Gods favour toward affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted remnants, when they are driven to cloſe with him in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and when in faith thereof they conſecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, to be for him, and at his diſpoſal; for, <hi>He ſhall be for our God.</hi> 4. Theſe who really turne unto God, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be uſefull and comfortable to the Church in their ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may expect to be truly honourable in the eyes of God and of his people, how many blots ſoever have been upon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for, <hi>He ſhall be as a governour in Judah,</hi> both for tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in duty, and eminency for reputation. 5. Even the moſt inveterate enemies to the Church may be gained by grace, and coming ſincerely, will be welcome; for, ſuch were the Philiſtines, of whom it is promiſed, <hi>Ekron ſhall be as a Jebuſite.</hi> 6. Teſtimonies of Gods prevailing with, and receiving ſuch as had been enemies and came to him, are not wanting in the Church to encourage the Church to waite on him, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others to come and make proof of his goodneſſe; for, here there is an inſtance of Jebuſites, who not only dwelt long in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but were ſome of them eminent in piety (as <hi>Arau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>) to be a confirmation of this promiſe concerning the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines: <hi>Ekron ſhall be as a Jebuſite.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſecond ground of encouragement unto the Church, is Gods preſervation of her in the midſt of calamities upon all round about her. Whereas they might be in danger by incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of enemies coming again and again upon them, and by armies ranging up and down in the Countreys about; the Lord promiſeth to guard his Church (ſignified by the Temple) that ſhe ſhould not be troubled with theſe tumults and incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169977:81"/>and particularly, that no oppreſſor ſhould paſſe through her: and that becauſe he had taken a ſufficient proof, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience had ſufficiently ſhewed the ſinfulneſſe and miſery of his people, and their inability to expede themſelves, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, out of their miſery, and had ſhewed alſo what their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies cruelty was. This being a promiſe peculiar to the Jewes, or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> however it was this farre verified before Chriſt, that when enemies came againſt theſe Cities before mentioned, or againſt themſelves, or were ranging to and again, through their land betwixt <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> they did not ſo go through as formerly to burn the Temple, and carry them captives. Yet the promiſe was not then fully accompliſhed; for, not only did oppreſſors go through the land, and make it tributary; yea, and many times profane the very Temple, but in proceſſe of time they were carried into captivity, and the Temple made a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: whereas here it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not paſſe through them any more.</hi> And therefore it ſeemeth we muſt expect a more full accompliſhment of this to converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in Gods preſerving his Church, and their poſſeſſion of their land in peace to them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Church may have many and great cauſes of fear, when God is about to do great things for her; for, ſhe hath <hi>armies, and paſſers by and returners,</hi> ſometime coming to deſtroy others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſometime to infeſt her ſelfe, which are a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to her. 2. Where the Lord hath his houſe and Church ſet up amongſt a people, and they look on that as their chief glory, he will protect it, and the State for the Churches ſake; for, <hi>I will encamp about my houſe,</hi> ſaith the Lord; and that is a ſafeguard to all the reſt. 3. In God alone there is alſufficiency to oppoſe unto all the Churches ſtraites and feares: and where he undertaketh to protect, no power of enemies will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, nor their aſſiduouſneſſe outweary him; for, <hi>his encamping</hi> is ſufficient to oppoſe unto <hi>an army,</hi> and unto <hi>him that paſſeth by and returneth,</hi> whether by enemies continuall recruiting of their forces after they are again and again beaten, or by daily incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which would weary any other army to watch over. 4. God is ſufficiently able, when he pleaſeth and ſeeth it for his peoples good, to turne all their ſtormes into a calme, and give them peaceable times without moleſtation from enemies, and continue it ſo during his pleaſure; for, he can make and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſueh a promiſe; <hi>No oppreſſor ſhall paſſe through them any more.</hi> Which may quiet their hearts who finde matters other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169977:82"/>ſeeing it is not ſo without his providence who knoweth what is beſt for his people. 5. When the Lord in afflicting his people, hath given them a proofe what their ſinfulneſſe and the miſery that followeth upon it is, and how unable they are to make up any breach betwixt him and them, or to be the better (without his help) of any hard uſage; then it is time for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to interpoſe, and make up the controverſie, and to prove it ſelfe as alſufficient as the creature is empty; for, ſo much is imported in this reaſon expreſſed after the manner of men, <hi>For now have I ſeen with mine eyes.</hi> He ſees their caſe, when he gives them an experimental proofe of it, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.18.6. Every degree of trouble and enemies cruelty let out upon the Church, as it is marked by God, and is a triall and diſcovery of what is in their heart, when they have the Church under their power: ſo it contributes to bring the Church nearer his heart, and to plead for deliverance; for, ſo much alſo doth this reaſon port, <hi>For now I have ſeen, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.25. and 3.7.</p>

It is ſufficient ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto the Church, that there is hope of Chriſts coming unto her, albeit ſhe be not in preſent poſſeſſion; <hi>ſhout, thy King cometh,</hi> ſaith he. 5.

Chriſt is a King that will do no wrong unto his ſubjects, but is to be acknowledged as juſt in all he doth, nor will ſuffer any to do them wrong, but he will avenge it, and he hath imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, whereby to juſtifie all his ſubjects who flee to him: this is matter of <hi>Zions</hi> joy, <hi>he is juſt,</hi> which includeth all theſe. 7. Chriſt alſo is a King, whoſe prerogative it is to ſave, when and in what exigent he pleaſeth; who, wherever he comes by the light of his countenance, he brings ſalvation with him, and hath purchaſed ſalvation to his people, by his ſaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of all that he engaged in for them; for, <hi>he bath ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 8. It ſets out much of the glory of Chriſts Kingdome, and contributes much for the encouragement of his ſubjects, that he is a lowly and a meek King, who will condeſcend to the low eſtate of his people, that he is eaſie to be intreated, not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked, not a ſore quarreller, one to whom there is eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and who will deal tenderly with his own; for, he is <hi>lowly</hi> or <hi>meek.</hi> 9. As Chriſts Kingdome is ſpiritual, and having no State like worldly Kings: So doth he prove his lowlineſſe and make it viſible to all, to take all ſcruple out of the heart of the humble, that they may not be deterred from coming to him; this is ſignified by his ſolemne entrie into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> without any ſtate, <hi>riding upon an aſſe, and a colt the foal of an aſſe,</hi> which poſture, whatever dignity was in it of old, (as <hi>Judges</hi> 5.10. &amp; 10.4. &amp; 12.14. 2. Sam. 17.23. &amp; 19.26.) yet in the dayes of this Prophecie, and the accompliſhment thereof, when great ones followed the cuſtomes of Kingdomes about them, it was a ſymboll of a low condition, eſpecially it being on an aſſe not as yet accuſtomed to riding, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.2.</p>

And yet he ſhould not want a Kingdome, but by the Goſpel of peace, would bring in the Gentiles, and get an univerſal Kingdome in the world, ſpoken of with allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the whole extent of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a type of the Church, and in their common ſpeech the borders thereof was put for the uttermoſt parts of the earth. But more eſpecially it ſeems to be a promiſe of Chriſts recalling <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the latter dayes to poſſeſſe their land, according to the ancient bounds thereof, to make up one Kingdome with <hi>the heathen</hi> formerly mentioned. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is righteous with God, where Chriſt is offered and rejected, to make them who will not be a Church or houſe to him, not to be a Kingdome or people; for, <hi>I will out off the horſe from Jeruſalem, and the battle-bowe ſhall be cut off,</hi> to wit, when Chriſt comes, and is not received, but cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them. 2. A people ſpared when others are deſtroyed, and yet continuing to adde to their provocations, may expect to partake of their lot who have gone before them, and that their former exemption will not alwayes endure; for, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are here joyned, not that there was any face of that Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when Chriſt came in the fleſh, but as <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> had been broken of old, ſo ſhould the Jewes be afterward; <hi>I will cut off the charet from Ephraim, and the horſe from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</hi> 3. Whomever God deſtroyes for rejecting Chriſt, yet Chriſt will not want a Kingdome in the world; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the Gentiles have a charter for being a part of Chriſts Kingdome; for, when the Jewes are broken in their power, he will <hi>ſpeak peace unto the heathen.</hi> 4. As the ſpiritual weapons
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169977:83"/>of Chriſts Kingdome, are the only effectual meanes for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people unto him, (whatever Chriſtian Magiſtrates ought to do for making way to the right exerciſe of theſe weapons;) ſo are they ſufficient of themſelves to bear out and prevaile, and carry their point againſt all oppoſition. Chriſt can by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, and holding out thereby the peace purchaſed for ſinners in his blood, prevaile over all Idolatry and power of men, and ſettle his Kingdome among them: yea and get upon the thrones which, Satan poſſeſſed; for, <hi>he ſhall ſpeak peace</hi> unto the Heathen, and thereby prevaile. 5. Chriſt his charter is to be an univerſall King, the bounds of whoſe Kingdome, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the world, or the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> is of Cods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, and who will want none of his right, oppoſe him who will; for, ſo is peremptorily declared here: <hi>His dominion ſhall be from ſea, even to ſea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.</hi>

                  <p>After the deſcription of this King; and the prediction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Kingdome; there is ſubjoyned a declaration and Prophecie concerning the benefits of his Kingdome, redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Church of the Jewes. Whereof the firſt (directed to the daughter of <hi>Zion</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is to be repeated from <hi>v.</hi> 9.) is, deliverance from their captivity and diſperſion, where they were halfe buried, without comfort, as in a dungeon, wanting ſo much as water to refreſh them; which deliverance comes by vertue of the Covenant, which had been ſealed by the blood of the ſacrifices, typifying the blood of Chriſt, which doth confirme it indeed, and purchaſes all the benefits thereof. This the Lord had already done for them in their deliverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi> as a pledge of the future returning of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, after Chriſts coming, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and after the calling of the Gentiles, <hi>v.</hi> 10 and he ſpeaks of this, as a thing paſt, becauſe of its certainty. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The deeper any of the people of God be in trouble, they lie nearer his heart and help: and he would have them look on the comforts of the Kingdome of Chriſt, and the Covenant, as eſpecially intended for them; therefore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169977:84"/>doth he apply the general comforts of Chriſts Kingdome to the diſtreſſed Jewes: <hi>As for thee alſo.</hi> 2. As the afflictions of the Lords people may be very bitter, and ſo ordered as they may be trials indeed: ſo there will be ſpecial notice taken of them, when their rods become ſo inſupportable, that there is no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting under them; for, he eyes them, when they are priſoners <hi>in a pit, wherein is no water,</hi> as ſometime they may be. 3. God entering in a Covenant with his people, condeſcends to take in all their outward neceſſities, and engages to have a care of them in theſe as well as in things ſpiritual; and ſo all their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies come by Covenant; for, it is by <hi>the covenant, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are ſent forth.</hi> 4. The mercies of the Church are not only rich and refreſhfull in themſelves, and in their Original, that they come through a Covenant of love, but in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that they are bought, and the Covenant concerning them made ſure by the blood of the Sonne of God; <hi>By the blood of thy covenant, I have ſent forth thy priſoners.</hi> 5. The Lord mindes his Covenant, and through, and for Chriſt makes the promiſes of it forth coming for his peoples good, when they have broken it on their part; for, though for their perfidiouſneſſe they were ſcattered, yet the Covenant ſtands to bring them back; <hi>Thy Covenant.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A ſecond benefit of his Kingdome redounding unto them, and the uſe of the former, is contained in an exhortation to all thoſe who either then were, or after their rejection of Chriſt ſhould be diſperſed as priſoners, that as they ſhould have hope of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſo they would make ready to returne to their land, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing unto them, that they ſhall be richly made up for all their loſſes. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No ſtraite of the Lords people can be ſo great, but there is matter and ground of hope in it, which ſhould be cheriſhed, to diſcover day-light unto us in a dark night; for, they are here <hi>priſoners of hope.</hi> 2. Hope in ſtraites is to be improven, for ſtrengthening to duty, and will hearten men to the uſe of meanes whereby the ſtraite may be removed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as heartleſneſſe layes men idle; for, <hi>priſoners of hope</hi> are <hi>to turn
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169977:84"/>them to their ſtrong hold.</hi> 3. The Church of God, how weak ſoever in her ſelfe, yet by reaſon of Gods protection is invincible and a ſafe refuge for toſſed people; for, it is <hi>a ſtrong hold, turn ye to the ſtrong hold.</hi> 4. Hope in God ſetting about duty, will never be aſhamed, but hath aſſurance of comfortable ſucceſſe; for, priſoners of hope, are in their duty ſeconded by a promiſe. 5. As the Lord may be intending comfortable things, when in the mean time his people are in great ſtraites; ſo hard times will not ſilence him from promiſing mercy, and ſhould not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our faith to believe it; for, <hi>even to day do I declare.</hi> 6. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of the Lords people, are in due time richly and doubly made up unto them, by their ſeeing double the miſery, that ever they ſuffered, afflicted on their enemies; by rich advantages and benefits from their own exerciſes, by doubling their felicity in reſpect of what they had, when it is for their good; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Chriſt every bleſſing is double, in it ſelfe, and in the purchaſe; in what it is, and in its being a pledge of eternal life: for, <hi>I will render double to thee.</hi> 7. In making up the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, the Lord hath an eſpecial eye to every one in particular, that they have no cauſe to account themſelves or their afflictions ſleighted; for, whereas before it was in the general <hi>priſoners,</hi> now the promiſe is particular to every one, I will render double <hi>to thee.</hi>

                     <p>When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bowe with Ephraim, and raiſed up thy ſonnes, O Zion, againſt thy ſonnes, O Greece, and made thee as the ſword of a mighty man.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>A third benefit promiſed unto them, (whereby alſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhall be accompliſhed) is victory over all their enemies that ſhall invade them, which was in part accompliſhed in the conflicts of the Jewes in the dayes of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> with their enemies who were a part of the broken Empire of <hi>Javau,</hi> or the Grecians; but conſidering that <hi>Ephraim</hi> is mentioned as well as <hi>Judah</hi> it ſeems to reach further, to victories to be attained both by <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or the ten tribes, againſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who it may be ſhall be inhabitants of <hi>Grecia,</hi> or the Turk. This promiſe is branched out, for more diſtinct confirmation, in ſeveral branches. As firſt, God employing them, as his bowe,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169977:85"/>arrowes and ſword, and ſtirring them up againſt their enemies, ſhall make them ſtrong. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The reaſon of courage and ſucceſſe, or the want of them, is not in the creature, but comes from God, who imployeth and layeth by, raiſeth up and caſts down; and according as he changes, the creature proves ſtrong or weake; for, the fountaine of the Churches victory, is Gods making <hi>Zion</hi> his <hi>bended bowe, Ephraim</hi> his arrowes to ſhoot, and his raiſing up <hi>Zions</hi> ſonnes againſt <hi>Greece.</hi> 2. The Church of God is too ſore a party for any oppoſite; in reſpect of that though ſhe be laid by, ſhe will be imployed again, and be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to fall to afreſh, after ſhe hath been overcome, and when God imployes her ſhe is invincible; for, though <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Zion</hi> were laid by, yet again <hi>God will bend Judah for him, &amp;c.</hi> and in his hand they ſhall be as the <hi>ſword of a mighty man,</hi> or <hi>giant.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A ſecond branch of the promiſe is, God ſhall be General in their enterpriſes, ſhall protect them as of old he did by the cloud, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19. ſhall animate them as by a trumpet blown; and fight from Heaven with thunder and lightning, and ſcatter and overturne all as whirlewindes do in the deſerts to the South of <hi>Judah:</hi> or, as when he overthrew <hi>Egypt</hi> at the Red-ſea, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 77.16, 17, 18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Churches defence and victory is of God, who is chiefe in her enterpriſes againſt her enemies, and delights to be ſeen on her behalfe, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her and making her victorious; for, <hi>The Lord ſhall be ſeen over them, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The Church and her wel-being is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in Gods ſight, that he will do ſtrange things ere ſhe be not delivered, and he brings her to extremities, that her help may be ſeen to be from Heaven; for, <hi>His arrow ſhall go forth as lightning: and he ſhall go forth with whirlewindes of the South.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A third branch of the promiſe is, God, going forth for them, ſhall not only defend them, but give them victory, and make them devour and ſubdue their enemies who are as baſe as ſtones caſt out of a ſling, (or, ſhall overcome them, though they had but ſling-ſtones to fight with, as <hi>David</hi> had when he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Goliah</hi>) and ſhall make it a compleat victory, and full execution, ſo that their ſwords ſhall be ſatiate with blood and ſlaughter, as the bowles or baſins of the Temple, and corners of the Altar, were with the blood of ſacrifices; and themſelves ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied abundantly with the victory, and ſpoiles, to make them keep feaſts and be merry; if not alſo to offer praiſe to God, which is ſpoken of in tearmes taken from the ceremoniall law, wherein they filled the bowles with the blood of ſacrifices.

When the Lord pleads the cauſe of his people, he will not only give ſuch proof of himſelfe as may curb enemies, but ſuch as may fully ſatisfie his people, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and refreſh their ſpirits, and make them praiſe him: This is ſignified by this ſatiety of blood and ſpoile promiſed to make

Every new look of Gods mercies toward his people, will diſcover more and more in them to refreſh their hearts; for, here at every new repetition there is more to ſay. 2. That which is chiefly remarkable and refreſhful in the Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, is the ſeeing of the glorious power of God, his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and tender mercy toward them ſhining in it: as here, <hi>The Lord their God ſhall ſave them in that day as the flock of his people:</hi> his doing of it as being their Conſederate God, and tender ſhepherd, looking on all the reſt of the world, as goats, and ſwine, and boares, commends it to them. 3.

However the Lords people may ſometimes be in a contemptible-like condition, yet in due time their preciouſneſſe in Gods eyes ſhall be viſible, and they ſhall be ſuch monuments of his power and love, as may invite others to joyne with them; for, <hi>They ſhall be as the ſtones of a Crown lifted up, as an Enſigne upon his land.</hi>

                  <p>A fourth benefit promiſed unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> through Chriſt, is, the making of their land fruitful in ſuch meaſure of corne and wine, as ſhould make them full of vigour and mirth, and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the aged who moſt need it, but even the younger ſort for their further pleaſure and refreſhment; the confideration of all which benefits tends to the commendation of Gods goodneſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, which as it is the fountain of them all, ſo it is here admired at. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

As Gods free love and goodneſſe is the fountain of all his peoples mercy; ſo he will in due time (whatever hard thoughts his people have of him,) get a commendation from them as good and doing good: <hi>For how great is his goodneſſe!</hi> 4. Gods goodneſſe ſeen in his preſent dealing, ought alſo to commend the beauty of all his by paſt adminiſtrations, as admirably car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to ſuch a cloſe; and ſhould make us rebuke our ſelves for judging otherwiſe at any time, and ought to commend his own beauty and comelineſſe to our hearts, that we may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace himſelf as a portion, without reſting on any particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit: For, <hi>how great is his beauty!</hi> is ſubjoyned to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. 5. The Lords goodneſſe and excellency, infinitely ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the reach of creatures capacity, and may be adored and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, but cannot be comprehended or fathomed; and our commending and declaring of it is beſt performed, when we ſet it moſt above the reach of our ability; ſo much doth this way of admiration import: <hi>How great is his goodneſſe, and how great is his beautie!</hi>

                  <p>IN this Chapter we have a continuation of the former Sermon, wherein, 1. He directs <hi>Iſrael</hi> to employ God for the ſupply of their neceſſities, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and not idols who do but deceive, as their fathers had found in Gods juſt diſpleaſure at their ſins, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. whereas God hath given proof of his love and ability to ſave, to encourage them to ſeek him, <hi>v.</hi>—3. 2. He proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the former prophecie, concerning <hi>Iſraels</hi> reſtitution and victories, promiſing to fit them with all neceſſaries for their own defence, and for attaining victory, <hi>v.</hi> 4. to ſtrengthen them to ſubdue their enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 5. to recollect ſcattered <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and joyne them with <hi>Judah,</hi> and reſtore them fully, <hi>v.</hi> 6. to ſtrengthen theſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> particularly, and fill them and their poſterity with conſolations, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and he confirmeth more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that promiſe of reſtoring <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhewing that he will do it eaſily with an hiſſe, and make them increaſe as formerly, <hi>v.</hi> 8. that he will preſerve them in their ſcattering, as ſeed in the ground, till the time of their Converſion and reſtitution, <hi>v.</hi> 9. And that he will remove difficulties in their way, ariſing from the power of enemies, or other impediments, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. unto all which is ſubjoyned a prediction of their being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by all theſe diſpenſations, to be an holy people, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>

                  <p>This part of the Chapter depends upon the cloſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, wherein, having promiſed plenty, direction is here given how to obtain it, to wit, by employing God to ſend raine, to bring the fruits to maturity, with a promiſe that God ſhould ſend bright clouds, (or lightnings a forerunner of raine) which will poure out themſelves in ſhowres, to cauſe plenty for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169977:87"/>them and their beaſts. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord purpoſeth much mercy to his people, yet he will be employed, and put to it by their prayers, to do it for them, that they may ſee the more of his love in it, and acknowledge him for it; for, after the promiſe of plenty, <hi>ch.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Ask ye of the Lord raine, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith he. 2. Notwithſtanding the eſtabliſhed courſe of nature, yet God reſerves the diſpoſing of all Providences in his own hand: and will evidence this eſpecially in his way to his own Church; for, albeit God hath ſetled a courſe of former and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter raine, yet they are to <hi>ask it of God,</hi> and <hi>Canaan</hi> was a land which eſpecially depended on the dew and raine of heaven, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.11, 12. 3. Needy man calls for many things to ſupply his neceſſities, and many things concur to ſerve him, which only God is powerful to ſupply; however he be much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: for, fraile man could be ruined by the very clouds their denying their influence, and they at Gods direction, (who only can create and direct them) weary themſelves to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the earth for mans good; <hi>Ask ye of the Lord raine, ſo the Lord will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord hath a reſpect to every one that ſeeks him, and to every one of the meaneſt neceſſities of every one that ſeek him; for, to an asking people he will give <hi>to every one the graſſe of the field,</hi> to ſupply their very beaſts neceſſities, much more their own, under that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral including all the fruits of the field, fit for man and beaſt.</p>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>For the idols have ſpoken vanity, and the diviners have ſeen a lie, and have told falſe dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, becauſe there <hi>was</hi> no ſhepherd.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Unto this exhortation to employ God, is ſubjoyned a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion from uſing ſinful courſes to ſupply their neceſſities,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169977:88"/>and particularly, that they forſake not the true God, and follow Idols, Aſtrologers, and vain dreamers, reaſons whereof are taken, partly from the emptineſſe of theſe meanes in all ages, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols revealing nothing to be truſted in, diviners being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deluded, could tell no better then they ſaw, their dreams being falſe for matter, contrary to the Word, and proving falſe in the end, and ſo they proved falſe comforters: partly from the experience of their fathers, who following theſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, were ſent into captivity as a flock without a ſhepherd, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods care, and being miſ-led by their Rulers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord ſeeks his people to renounce all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, and only employ and depend on him, he is ſeeking their real good and happineſſe in it, and to lead them from their own ruine; for, ſo he declares here, <hi>Ask ye of the Lord, and he will give ſhowres;</hi> but employ idols, <hi>and the idols have ſpoken vanity, &amp;c.</hi> and this is his reaſon why he exhorts them to ſeek him only, <hi>Ask ye of the Lord rain, for the idols have ſpoken vanity.</hi> 2. Whoever renounce truſt in the Lord, and the way of his ſervice, and embrace falſe religions or wayes, in hope of ſucceſſe and proſperity, will meet with miſerable diſappointment: and faire promiſes of comfort that way, will in performance prove emptineſſe and falſhood; for, ſo it is here, <hi>Vanity, lies, falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and comforting in vaine,</hi> is the beſt that can be expected <hi>of idols and diviners.</hi> 3. Experience of the fruit of ſinful wayes, ought to make fooles wiſe, and it is a double ſin to fall over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the ſin, for which we have felt affliction our ſelves, or ſeen others ſmart: therefore doth he warne them from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers experience, who eſſayed theſe ſinful wayes. 4. Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of God, and cleaving unto idols, though it may ſeem to be a cauſe of proſperity, (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17.) yet it will draw on captivity, deſolation, and ſore troubles; for, <hi>therefore they went away as a flock,</hi> ſcattered here and there, as a flock before the Wolfe. 5. Whatever people may think in their proſperity, yet their adverſity will diſcover how ſad it is to caſt themſelves out of Gods protection, and to have followed ſuch idols as faile them in their ſtrait; and how ſad to have wanted faithful Rulers, to do their duty for keeping them right: both theſe may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this, <hi>They were troubled becauſe there was no ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi> They found the fruit of wicked Rulers Government, when they came into captivity, and what a plague it was to be left to their idols, and without Gods care, as a flock wanting a</p>

                     <p>Mine anger was kindled againſt the ſhepherds, and I puniſhed the goats: for the LORD of hoſtes hath viſited his flock the houſe of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horſe in the battel.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In the firſt part of this verſe, the Lord cleares ſome more or his minde in that ſtroak on their fathers, for their childrens uſe, to wit, that in their captivity, his anger had been againſt the wicked goats among them, and eſpecially their wicked Rulers both in Church and State, who had been goats for inſolencie, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34.17. rather then ſhepherds, and not againſt any that ſought him amongſt them: and therefore they would take heed, leſt he ſtill puniſh ſuch, and ſo be ſtirred up to depend on him. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. The right underſtanding of Gods ſad diſpenſations againſt his people, is a leſſon of his own teaching: therefore himſelf expounds it here. 2. The outward ſtroak is not all to be looked to, for right uſe-making of afflictions, but eſpecially what is the controverſie, and whom God is angry at: for, ſo is here cleared, <hi>My anger was kindled wainſt the ſhepherds, and I puniſhed the goats.</hi> 3. When God puniſheth his Church and people, however ſtroaks and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations may be diſtributed, yet his ſpecial quarrel is againſt the wicked and ungodly, and theſe who have had greateſt hand in the provocation, and particularly wicked Rulers, are the chief but of his diſpleaſure; for, <hi>Mine anger was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſhepherds, and I puniſhed the goats.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the latter part of the verſe, the Lord confirmes that his quarrel was eſpecially againſt the wicked, and their perverſe Rulers; for, however he had ſent his people into captivity, to cut off ſuch a corrupt crew, yet he had not caſt them off, but had viſited, (and would yet viſit) them in their afflictions, as a ſhepherd doth his flock, and would employ and govern them, in defending themſelves againſt their enemies, as a Rider doth his horſe. And ſo gives another reaſon, encouraging them to employ God only, conſidering what he had done and would do for them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord will in due time give proof, that whatever deluges of trouble he let looſe upon the Church, becauſe of the iniquities that are therein, yet that he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:169977:89"/>hath not caſt off his relation and affection to her, but will, when his work, and her trial are perfected, own her in her loweſt eſtate, and deliver her; this is given as a confirmation of what he had ſaid; <hi>For the Lord of hoſts hath viſited his flock the houſe of Judah.</hi> 2. Gods relation to his people, and his employing of them, is ſufficient to make nothing to be ſomewhat: for, <hi>He makes them as his goodly horſe in the battel.</hi> 3. God hath, and doth from day to day, let forth ſuch proofes of himſelf unto his people, as may ſufficiently convince them of the advantages of ſeeking to him only; this is a reaſon for employing God, and not idols; <hi>For the Lord of hoſtes hath viſited, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>To clear this of Gods change of dealing, the Lord proſecutes the former prophecy, concerning his mercies toward <hi>Iudah</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſrael,</hi> holding forth many promiſes and confirmations thereof concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their victories, converſion and reſtitution, of which whatever performance the Jewes had before Chriſt, or <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit gets under Chriſt in a ſpiritual way, yet they relate further to the Converſion of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt promiſe is, that albeit they ſhould be expoſed to inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet God ſhould furniſh them with all neceſſaries for their own eſtabliſhment, and prevailing over their enemies: they ſhould be furniſhed with Governours as corner-ſtones, to keep the building firme and in frame, and compleat officers, as a nail faſtening timber, or to hold all veſſels, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 22.23. &amp; with furniture for war, and ability to prevail and make their enemies tributary. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Government and order among the people of God is ſo neceſſary, as a corner-ſtone in a building, and a naile in a tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-frame; that the granting thereof by God is a great mercy, and a pledge of his turning in favour to them; for, <hi>Out of him came forth the corner and the naile,</hi> is a proofe of his love. 2. When God ſees it good for his people, he can eaſily enable them to be Conquerours, and bring them in ſubjection who had been their oppreſſors; for, <hi>Out of him came the battel-howe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169977:89"/>and every oppreſſour,</hi> (or, <hi>exactour of tribute,</hi> as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth) <hi>together.</hi>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>And they ſhall be as mighty men which tread down <hi>their enemies</hi> in the mire of the ſtreets in the battle, and they ſhall fight becauſe the LORD <hi>is</hi> with them, and the riders on horſes ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The ſecond promiſe explains further their power to prevaile over their enemies; that they ſhould be ſtrong as giants, to tread down their enemies, and even to ſhame and put to flight horſemen, though not by their own ſtrength. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is no power nor might can prevail againſt the Church ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by God, but when diſadvantages are greateſt, victory ſhall be moſt remarkable: for, <hi>They ſhall be as mighty men to tread down their enemies as mire, and confound riders on horſes.</hi> 2. The ſtrength whereby the Church is inabled to beare out and wraſtle with difficulties, is much and frequently to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and remarked; therefore is it again held out in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. 3. As the Churches ſtrength to go through, is not het own, ſo it is neceſſary that God be much exalted and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for it, when ſhe hath it; this is held forth for our uſe. <hi>They ſhall fight becauſe the Lord is with them,</hi> reconciled and in Covenant with them, and aſſiſting them in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>

                     <p>And I will ſtrengthen the houſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and I will ſave the houſe of Joſeph, and I will bring them again to place them, for I have mercy upon them: and they ſhall be as though I had not caſt them off: for I <hi>am</hi> the LORD their God, and will beare them.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The third promiſe is, that as he will ſtrengthen <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo he will convert and aſſert the ten tribes out of trouble, and ſo joyne them with <hi>Judah,</hi> and bring them again not only to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169977:90"/>Church, (which is imported in their being ſaved,) but (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) to their own land: and reſtore them to his favours, and take away the ſignes of his anger as if they had never been rejected. The cauſes whereof are his mercy, and the conſtancy of his Covenant, turning them to ſeek him, and hearing them when they ſeek. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a point of truth ſeriouſly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by Gods afflicted people, that he can, and in due time, will not only ſtrengthen them to endure their lot, but enable them to recover their wonted power and ability, after they have been exhauſted with many calamities; therefore is the promiſe ſo oft repeated; <hi>I will ſize<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g then the houſe of Judah.</hi> 2. Theſe who belong unto the Lord and his Covenant, though they may be long caſt off, and in a loſt condition, for trouble and captivity; yet God will ſeek them out, bring them again to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſet them free from all troubles: of this, his dealing with the ten tribes is a ſpecial inſtance, whoſe right to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is unalterable by any temporal rejection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28, 29. <hi>I will ſave the houſe of Joſeph.</hi> 3. When God turnes his people to him, not only doth his favour ſhine upon them, but their priviledges loſt through ſin, are reſtored unto them; according to the tenour of his Covenant made with them; for, the houſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> being ſaved, <hi>I will bring them again to place them,</hi> the promiſe made concerning their land (as appears this ſhould be underſtood) is forth-coming when they come to God. 4. Tender mercie in God will bring about good things to his people, where there is no other probability thereof, and it is an argument ſufficient to move him to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to them, that in ſo doing he will magnifie his own mercy; this is the reaſon of the promiſe, <hi>For I have mercy upon them.</hi> 5. A people turning unto God, however they have ſuſtained ſad calamities, and ſuch marks of his diſpleaſure, as it would ſeem, ſhould leave a perpetual print behinde them; yet they may expect that God can fully reſtore deplorable conditions, and is willing to do it in outward things, in ſo far as is for their good; whereof his promiſe to <hi>Iſrael</hi> is an inſtance. <hi>They ſhall be as if I had not caſt them off:</hi> and holds alwayes true in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mercies, that upon repentance and fleeing to Chriſt, the ſinner is in due time reſtored to Gods favour, as if he had not hid his face from him. 6. Gods entering in Covenant with his people, is a bond which ſtands firme, notwithſtanding many temporal ſad lots, and will be forth-coming for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169977:90"/>after it hath ſeemed to be made void for a long time; this is another argument, why the Lord will reſtore <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even that he may give a proof of the conſtancy of his Covenant, <hi>For I am the Lord their God.</hi> 7. As it is a ſweet fruit of Gods keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, when he brings back his people from their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to ſeek him and call upon him: ſo the Covenant aſſures the Supplicant of getting audience; this followes on his being their God, <hi>I will heare them,</hi> which preſuppoſeth that he will convert them to pray to him.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The fourth promiſe is directed eſpecially to the ten tribes, that they ſhall alſo be made giants in the common cauſe of the Jewiſh Church, that they ſhall be filled with conſolation as with wine, and that their children who ſucceed them ſhall enjoy the ſame mercies, and ſhall rejoyce in God, and follow the Chriſtian Religion of their Progenitors. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1 In a time of love, the Lord hath a ſpecial reſpect unto theſe who have taſted deepeſt of trouble, and whoſe condition ſeems moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, that they may be aſſured of his good will, and not come behinde with any; therefore <hi>Ephraim</hi> or the ten tribes get the promiſes repeated, and the ſame with what was given to <hi>Judah, v.</hi> 5. <hi>And Ephraim ſhall be like a mighty man.</hi> 2. The Lords appearing for his people will change their condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any thing that their caſe in probability could promiſe: for, broken and undone <hi>Ephraim,</hi> being aſſiſted of God, <hi>ſhall be like a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ghty man.</hi> 3. Albeit the conſolations of Gods people may oft times be under the clod, yet when he returns unto them, he allowes comfort upon them, which is able to refreſh and chear up their heart, as if they had the choice of outward delights, and it is Gods work to apply theſe conſolations effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; for, <hi>Their heart ſhall rejoyce as through wine,</hi> ſaith he, undertaking to give matter of comfort, and to make it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. 4. The continuance of the Church from generation to generation, and the mercies of poſterity, are matter of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

As the Lord will have a Church in every generation, and particularly a Church of Jewes and Iſraelites after their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, till his ſecond coming; ſo the Lord hath reſerved for every genetation their own peculiar mercies, which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh them; <hi>Their children ſhall ſee it,</hi> (to wit, Gods mercy, and the renewed performance of theſe promiſes) <hi>and be glad,</hi> 6. Right joy in the Church ought not only to ariſe upon ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grounds, but to be managed and expreſſed ſpiritually, ſo as the Lord alone, and her intereſt in him, and not any outward favour, nor any ſpiritual and good thing as it is an habit in her, ought to be the matter of her gloriation; therefore is it added, <hi>Their heart ſhall rejoyce in the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe promiſes in regard they were incredible, and many difficulties ſtood in the way of performance, are amplified and confirmed, and every difficulty taken out of the way by new promiſes. And firſt in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he aſſures them that he can and will as eaſily gather them, as a ſhepherd gathers his flock with an hiſſe, and gives a reaſon of his gathering them, not ſo much becauſe he had given that Nation of old proofes of his power, in temporal deliverances, (though that be true alſo, and was a pledge of good to them) as becauſe of the price paid for the Elect among them: and further, he inlarges the promiſe, that being returned and reſtored, he will make them to increaſe as of old. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Difficulties in the way of a thing promiſed of God, ought not to drive us to doubt of performance; God who makes the promiſe, undertaking to ſee to, and come over all difficulties; and it beſeems both the power, wiſdom, and love of God toward his people, to have difficulties lying in the way of promiſes made to them, that he may be exalted, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king oppoſition ineffectual. And in particular, no impoſſibility ought to make us queſtion the mercies promiſed unto all <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:169977:91"/>ſince God undertakes to performe them; for, to this ſcope do all theſe confirmations of the promiſes tend. 2. Such is the power and wiſdome of God, that what ſeemes not only difficult, but impoſſible, he can, and (having promiſed it) will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it, but do it moſt eaſily, and without any trouble; for, if he but <hi>hiſſe for them, he will gather them</hi> 3. Such as Chriſt hath redeemed and paid a price to juſtice for, as they are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to him, ſo they cannot periſh, but will in due time be brought to Chriſt and ſaved, whatever difficulty ſeem to be in the way; for it is ſaid, that for the redeemeds ſake; (which Chriſt declares there are) <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be converted, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>For I have redeemed them.</hi> 4. Chriſts redeemed ones are not only bleſſed themſelves, but are great bleſſings to the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church and Nation to which they belong; for, it is for the redeemed and elects ſake, that the whole Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is brought to the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>I will gather them, for I have redeemed them.</hi> 5. The gracious purpoſes of Gods heart toward his people are not ſoon told nor conceived; but as the fountaine is infinite, ſo are his outlettings, according to their capacity: Therefore at the repetition of the promiſe, there is a new addition to it; <hi>They ſhall increaſe as they have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>creaſed.</hi> 6. There is no work that God hath done for his people, but he can do the like again, and the beſt times that the Church hath had can be repeated again and get a parallel, when it is for her good; for, here a proofe of this is promiſed to <hi>Iſrael.

                  </q>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas their ſcattering among the Nations might be looked on as a great difficulty; the Lord promiſeth to turn that into a ſowing of them among the Nations and in remote parts, partly ſo keeping them as winter-ſeed in the ground till the ſpring-time of their converſion and reſtitution; and partly, making them ſeed to bring in an increaſe of the fulneſſe of the Gentiles at their converſion, as their Synagogues were a ſpecial meanes of publiſhing the Goſpel at firſt to the Gentiles. And
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169977:92"/>further the Lord promiſeth, that their ſcattering ſhould not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their converſion; for, while they are ſcattered, the vaile ſhall be taken away, and they ſhall remember the Lord, and they and their children being preſerved, ſhall returue to God, and (as appears, it being oppoſed to their being ſcattered in fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no hard lot lying on the people of God, nor difficulty lying in the way of their mercy, but God cannot only remove it, but turne it in a bleſſing; ſo doth the Lord promiſe he will order <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering. 2. As the preſervation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their wandering or loſt condition, in order to their future converſion is a great mercy unto them, whatever it ſeem for preſent: ſo the mercy of their ſcattering will further appear, when the Lord ſhall make their being converted, as ſeed to bring in much increaſe of the Gentiles with them unto the Lord; this is imported in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>I will ſowe them among the people.</hi> 3. As the firſt thing that the Lords people get and are to ſeek of him, is converſion and reconciliation to himſelfe, upon which every good thing fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: ſo mercy and a purpoſe of love will ſeek out, and finde theſe it is ſent to, notwithſtanding all diſadvantages; for, ſo is imported in that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is converted, even in their exile and ſcattering, and before any other proof of favour. <hi>They ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me in farre countreys.</hi> True converſion unto God, not only ſets him up high in the heart, and makes him chief in the deſires, and ſtretches out the ſoul for ſuch further enjoyments of him as he hath promiſed; but will lead the ſoul back to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible of its prejudice by being ſormerly deprived of God; <hi>They ſhall remember me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, that is, call to minde what faire priviledges they have been deprived of through their inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and being now ſcattered, ſhall long to enjoy the wonted proofes of Gods love. A forme of ſpeech which is made uſe of alſo to expreſſe their exerciſe under the captivity of <hi>Babylon, Iſa.</hi> 26.8. 5.

                  </q>
                  <p>Thirdly, wheteas the power of great enemies on all hands, might appear to be a great difficulty; the Lord promiſeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them even from the ſtrongeſt, as of old he did from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and now of late (as ſome of them who were about the work in <hi>Zechariahs</hi> time had ſeen) from <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> and that he ſhould bring them back in ſo great numbers, as to poſſeſſe the outmoſt coaſts of their land, (as <hi>Gilead</hi> and <hi>Lebanon</hi> were,) all which ſhould be too little to containe them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No oppoſition or power of men ſhall be able to fruſtrate or hinder Gods purpoſes of love toward his Church, but that, either by faire meanes, ſtirring them up to do his work (as he did with <hi>Gyrus</hi>) or by foule meanes, cruſhing their oppoſition, (as he proved on <hi>Egypt</hi>) he will gaine his point: of this the Lord hath given proofes of old, as pledges to his Church in all ages, and particularly to his <hi>Iſrael: I will bring them again alſo out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Aſſyria.</hi> 2. Albeit the Lords people who have intereſt in him, may be farre ſcattered in all the corners of the earth, yet he will want none of them, but will ſeek and finde them in all quarters; for, though they be in <hi>Egypt</hi> on the South, and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> on the North-hand, yet <hi>he will bring them again, and gather them.</hi> 3. Whatever decay the people of God may be threatened with through much affliction, yet God can make them wonderfully to increaſe, and be more in number at their delivery, then they were before their ſtroake; This is to be verified in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom the ancient bounds of their land ſhall hardly containe when they are converted to God: <hi>I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and place ſhall not be found for them.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Fourthly, whereas there might be many other impediments
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169977:93"/>in the way of their return, joyned with the power of enemies, to oppoſe them, or keep them captives, (as <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh or Aſſyrian Empire did,) the Lord promiſeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as when he brought his people out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and dried up Seas and rivers; and to deal with enemies as when he brought down the pride of <hi>Sennacherib</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and when he drowned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the power of <hi>Egypts</hi> Kingdome. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However difficulty upon difficulty may ſtart up to oppoſe the Churches happineſſe, yet the Lord is ſufficient to do all his pleaſure, and to make his way and his peoples the more conſpicuous, that there be difficulty in it; for, <hi>He will paſſe through Seas, and drie up rivers, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Whatever oppoſition is laid in Gods way, will not prove an hinderance to him, but brings trouble to it ſelfe for its attempt; this was proved on the <hi>Sea, which he paſſed through with affliction</hi> (or, <hi>trouble,</hi> alluding to the trouble of the Red-ſea, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11 4.3.) <hi>and ſmote the waves of the Sea,</hi> and promiſes to make good the like on all oppoſition. 3. The Lord will not ſtand in delivering his people, to overturn the very courſe of nature, to cruſh mens chief excellencies, and whatever elſe they are proud of, yea and to overturne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ere his people be not happy; for, he will drie up Seas and rivers, <hi>And the pride of Aſſyria ſhall be brought down, and the ſcepter of Egypt ſhall depart away.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>This Prophecie is cloſed with a promiſe, concerning their way and carriage for whom the Lord doth all this, that they ſhall be encouraged and ſtrengthened to be an holy people, and to perſevere in faith and obedience, which is to be underſtood of the elect and truly godly among them, who yet at that time will be very many. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord hath done great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things for his people, it is yet a new gift to give them the uſe thereof, to encourage and ſtrengthen them thereby; for, it is a new promiſe, <hi>I will ſtrengthen them.</hi> 2. As God can eaſily encourage the moſt feeble and faint-hearted, ſo their ſure grip of it is to have it laid up in God for them, and by faith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance draw it forth as there is need, <hi>I will ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ngthen them in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169977:93"/>the Lord,</hi> ſaith he. 3. Encouragement in God is only well improven when it is made uſe of to ſtrengthen unto holineſſe and perſeverance, which is the only ſweet fruit of all mercies, rendering them comfortable to the receiver, when he is led nearer God by them; <hi>I will ſtrengthen them, and they ſhall walk up and down,</hi> or, <hi>inceſſantly walk,</hi> to wit, in their duty. 4. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is then rightly ſet about, when we are conſtantly in it, when we adhere cloſe to the rule, when by faith we draw fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture out of God, and aime at his glory, and give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all our performances: for ſo much is imported here, <hi>They ſhall inceſſantly walk in his Name. His Name</hi> imports what he hath revealed of himſelfe for directing our way, and for us to place our confidence in, and <hi>his Name</hi> revealing himſelfe, is his glory, which every one by walking holily and confidently, ought to ſtudy to make more conſpicuous. 5. The Lord needs not be hindered to ſhew himſelfe gracious, by the unworthineſſe and unholineſſe of his people, but when he is about to do them good, be can be ſurety to himſelfe, that the fruit thereof ſhall be forth-coming to his glory; and can make them he doth much for, to be ſuch a people as his dealing toward them obliges them to be; therefore, after all the former promiſes, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe undertakes to make them holy; <hi>They ſhall walk up and down in his Name.</hi> 6. The ſweet comfort and refreſhment of the promiſes will only be felt by theſe who dwell much on the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of God the promiſe-maker, and conſider how alſufficient he is, and how worthy to be credited for the performance of what he promiſeth; Therefore doth he ſubſcribe his Name to all this Prophecie, <hi>ſaith Jehovah.</hi>

                  <p>This judgement is again repeated and amplified, from the cauſe procuring the ſame, which was their rejecting of Chriſt, unto whom ſomewhat of this Prophecie is expreſly applied, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. This the Prophet not only foretells, but repreſents at large as a thing in acting, making alſo uſe of ſome external types (as appeares, <hi>v.</hi> 15.) to ſet it out to the preſent Jewes. And firſt he repreſents a charge laid on Chriſt by his Father, to have a care of that people, during the prefixed time of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, while this calamity was going on, and that people were uſed as ſheep appointed for the ſlaughter, by all theſe, whether Natives or Forreigners, that had any power over them, who uſing them ſeverely at their pleaſure (as men either ſlay or ſell their flocks, as being their own,) were ſo farre from thinking they did wrong, that they thought it a bleſſing from God to be made rich, though it were by the miſery of the people. In this time Chriſt gets a charge by his Prophets, and eſpecially by his own coming in the fleſh, to be a ſhepherd to the Jewes, chiefly for the elects ſake among them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt is the great ſhepherd and overſeer of his Church, who not only went about that office in his own perſon, but in all ages provides his Church of leaders, by whom he feeds and hath a care of her, and he it is through whom any of theſe meanes do her good; for, unto him it is ſaid, <hi>Feed the flock.</hi> 1. The benefit and comfort of Chriſts office and relation to his Church, is beſt ſeen, when the riſe of it is ſeen to be not only from his own tender heart, but from a command laid upon him by his Father, to take charge of the Church, and elect in it, as one that muſt be accountable; and from a Covenant of Redemption, whereby the Father hath engaged himſelfe to be a God unto his Sonne as Mediator, and to theſe that flee to him, and to ſave all theſe whom he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem: Thus is Chriſts Office held out unto us here, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord my God, Feed the flock.</hi> 3. Herein doth the Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and long-ſuffering toward his Church appear, that he doth not inflict ſaddeſt ſtrokes, nor totally ruine, till it be ſeen, that Chriſt and an offer of mercy is rejected: and that cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities come to an height, only when the matter is otherwiſe paſt remedy; for here, before this growing calamity come to an height, Chriſt is ſent out to feed the flock. 4. It may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Chriſt to the Churches choice, that much trouble will endear her to his care, if ſhe embrace him; and his people who make uſe of him ſhall finde that no afflictions ſhall eſtrange
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169977:96"/>him from them, but rather make them the more capable of his feeding, and him the more tender of them: and that the more they are wronged by others who ſhould guide and be Paſtors to them, he will ſee the more to their wel-being; and that he will be near at hand under calamities, to welcome any who flee to him, to be freed from them, or from the curſe of them; for, he will <hi>feed the flock of the ſlaughter, whoſe poſſeſſors ſlay them.</hi> 5. As corrupt Rulers are oftentimes made the ſcourge and plague of a ſinfull people, ſo it is great cruelty in men, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their power given them for the good of a people, to their ruine; for, it is marked as the way of the peoples calamity, and the Rulers ſinne, <hi>Their poſſeſſors ſlay them, and their own ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds pity them not.</hi> 6. It is a great ſnare upon oppreſſors, not only to be given up to that ſinne, but (partly through their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences being deaded and blinded with ſuch a groſſe iniquity, and partly through their looking on the oppreſſeds guiltineſſe, or that themſelves are ſpared, and not puniſhed when they do evil) not to be convinced and challenged for it, but rather to think ſinne a duty; this is the ſnare and judgement of Rulers here, <hi>Their poſſeſſors ſlay them, and hold themſelves not guilty.</hi> 7. Proſperity and advantage by an evill courſe is a great ſnare, and a chiefe cauſe why men will not be convinced of the evill of it; for, <hi>I am rich,</hi> takes their mindes much up. 8. Sinne is moſt wickedly and dangerouſly committed and defended, when men colour all with a pretence of piety, pretending to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and acknowledge providence, when in the mean time they make providence and ſucceſſe a mark of Divine approbation, how contrary ſoever to the revealed will of God their courſe be; for, thus do theſe oppreſſors, <hi>They ſay, Bleſſed be the Lord, for I am rich.</hi> They take their enriching by oppreſſion, for a token of Gods approbation, and cover all with a pretence of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of God.</p>

He cut off in a ſhort time many of their wicked Governours, partly by calamities, (which certainly imported that there had been no ſmall plague on people, when publick judgements cut off ſo many Rulers,) and turning of Prieſts out of their Offices fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and eſpecially by his own Miniſtery, bringing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the ſects of their falſe teachers, Pharifees, Sadduces and Eſſenes, all which Chriſt did to reclaim them, but in vaine; their carriage was ſuch as provoked him againſt them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo they were more eſtranged from God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1 Chriſt taking a work in hand, can effectuate ſtrange things ſpeedily; for, <hi>in one moneth,</hi> (or a ſhort time) <hi>he cut off three</hi> (or many) <hi>ſhepherds.</hi> 2 Chriſt uſeth many times to make way for his own entertainment, by ſending calamities thick and threefold, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lay a neceſſity on people to come to him, by cutting off ſuch as had been inſtruments of ill unto his people, that he may commend his affection unto them, and by ſtaining and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-clouding falſe teachers and falſe wayes, that himſelf alone may be ſeen choice-worthy; for, <hi>cutting off three ſhepherds in the moneth,</hi> imports all theſe, he cut off evil governours, who had oppreſſed them, with whom no doubt many of the people fell, and brought their falſe teachers in contempt: all which he did to commend himſelf unto them as an excellent ſhepherd. 3. Chriſt exerciſing his tendereſt care of his Church, is oft-times met with very provoking carriage, depriving her of his favour, which ſhould be ſo much the bitterer to bear, as that Chriſt takes not away ſuch a mercy willingly; for, when Chriſt is thus feeding, they inſtead of turning to him, carry themſelves ſo, as <hi>that his ſoul loathed them,</hi> or was <hi>ſtraitened for them;</hi> or; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred them, but with grief, as his frequent complaints decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. 4.

Chriſt, for all his pains and care, is ordinarily leſſe thought of, and more baſely rewarded, then mens meaneſt ſervants; <hi>They weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my price thirty pieces of ſilver,</hi> the ordinary price of a ſlave, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.32. and more fit to be <hi>caſt unto the Potter,</hi> then given to Chriſt. 4 When men turn contemners and unde va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luers of Chriſt, they will readily turn perſecutors, and he will be thought worthy of nothing but death, and that which may help to bring him to it: for, thus it was in the event, Chriſts price was <hi>thirty pieces</hi> to <hi>Judas,</hi> to betray him. 5. The contempt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Chriſt as Mediatour, watching himſelf immediately or by his ſervants, for the good of the Church, is accounted of God to be a contemning of himſelf who fends him: <hi>The Lord
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:169977:99"/>ſaid, Caſt it to the Potter, a goodly price that I was prized at of them.</hi> 6. God will in due time make the conſciences of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners confeſſe the horridneſſe of their guilt; and not only ſo, but cauſe them by their practice to proclaim it; for, ſo did <hi>Judas</hi> by his repentance, and caſting back the ſilver in the Temple; and the High Prieſts by their not daring to put it among the treaſures of the Temple, as being the price of blood, and by their purchaſing with it a baſe field; this was the full accompliſhment of that typical action, <hi>I caſt them to the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the houſe of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Followes yet again their calamity, by way of puniſhment for this their ingratitude: and firſt, they are threatened with the breach of brotherly concord, (as when <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were rent aſunder under <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Solomons</hi> idolatry,) and with the removal of peace Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, (as was at large verified in the ſiege before their laſt deſtruction) ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way for the compleat breaking and ſcattering of the body of that Nation, as is ſeen this day, and for a long time obſtructing of that brotherhood betwixt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> under Chriſt, promiſed of old, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37.22. all which is ſignified by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the ſtaffe of bands. Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt hath multiplicity and variety of judgements, whereby to let contemners of him ſee and feel, that ſo to do is their great miſery; for, he hath yet <hi>another ſtaffe, even Bands, to cut aſunder.</hi> 2. It is a ſad judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fruit of a contemned Chriſt, when a Church is given up to rents and ſchiſmes, and when peace and concord is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken among a people; this ordinarily proves a preſage of ſad ſcattering, and an hinderance of many choice bleſſings; thus is Chriſts death puniſhed: <hi>I brake the brotherhood between Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Iſrael.</hi>

                  <p>This chapter is a continuation of that prophecie in the tenth chapter: for as the Lord thought it neceſſary to ſeaſon theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable promiſes with a denunciation of the deſolation, to come upon the Jewiſh Nation, leſt the ſecure and wicked ſhould break
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169977:101"/>their neck upon them, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. ſo leſt the godly hearing of theſe calamities, ſhould think that all hope were gone; the Lord ſubjoynes many comfortable promiſes in this chapter, which however they have their own accompliſhment, and yield com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God in all ages, yet the full accompliſhment of them is reſerved for converted <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for the day of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, is the time of their turning to God, and of their mourning, as we ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. Unto theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, two things are premitted in this verſe, 1. The nature of this doctrine, (at leaſt a great part of it) that it is a burdenſom word for the good and behoof of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being threatenings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iſraels</hi> enemies, but promiſes unto her. 2. Becauſe the promiſes many of them might ſeem incredible, therefore the Lord not only prefixes his Name, but proves his own Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, from his creating the Heavens, founding the earth on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and creating the ſoul of man, which may aſſure the Church of the certainty of what he promiſeth and ſaith. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lord will not alwayes write bitter things againſt his people, but in due time let out ſomewhat for their advantage: ſo times of comfort and love to them, will be ſad times to their enemies, and the promiſes unto them will be ſad threatenings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Not only doth the all-ſufficient Nature of God put the truth of his promiſes out of queſtion, but the viſible effects of his Omnipotency, in creating heaven, and earth by his naked word, and the upholding of the earth as a ball in the midſt of the aire, without any other foundation then a word of command, may ſhame all fleſh from ſuſpecting his ability to make good whatever he ſaith; from this is the enſuing doctrine confirmed, <hi>Jehovah ſaith it, who ſtretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth.</hi> 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that the Parent produceth man in reſpect of his bodie, and the uniting of the ſoul with the bodie, yet the Original of the ſoul of every man is from God, and it is immediatly created and infuſed into the body by him; for, it is here reckoned among the works of Creation and Omnipotencie, <hi>that God forms the ſpirit of

Every misbeleever of Gods Omnipotency to perform his promiſes, carrieth in his own boſome a refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf; the very excellencie of his ſoul, created ſo like God, which being put into a dead lump of clay, doth animate it, and fit it for excellent employments, may teach him what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible things God can work, and may particularly aſſure him, that God hath power over the ſpirits of men which he hath made, to order them ſo, as men ſhall not hinder the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his will: for, this is an antidote againſt infidelity; <hi>God formes the ſpirit of man within him.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſubſtance of all this enſuing doctrine, may be reduced to theſe three Heads; that the Lord will plague the Churches perſecutors, and give his Church victory over them; that he will defend, preſerve and eſtabliſh his Church, which followeth on the former: and that he will give his Church converſion and repentance, as the meanes to haſten on and perfect the other two. Theſe three are in this chapter propounded, enlarged and amplified in ſeveral particular promiſes, for their more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and particular information and encouragement.</p>
                  <p>The firſt promiſe is in ſumme thus, that the trouble where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto enemies ſhall put the Church, ſhall be ſo far from rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her; that troubling of her ſhall be her troublers ruine, as if they had drunk a cup of poiſon, when they would ſwallow her, which ſhall produce trembling by exhauſting their vigour and radical heat, or ſlumbering and aſtoniſhment, and make them reele and daſh like drunken men, till they fall and periſh, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Even when the Lord hath done great things for his people, and delivered them, they are not to expect exemption from troubles and exerciſes; for, here it is ſuppoſed that reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iſrael</hi> are not utterly caſt off, but reſtored, and yet are in ſtraits and beſieged, <hi>All the people round about are in the ſiege, both againſt Judah, and againſt Jeruſalem.</hi> 2. The enemies of the Church are very cruel, and earneſt in their purſuit of her;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169977:102"/>and it is as great delight to them to vex and devoure her, as it is for a thirſty man to drink; for, <hi>Jeruſalem is a cup,</hi> which they are earneſt to drink down. 3. When the Lord permits his Church to be in a condition of trouble and hazard, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not only make enemies to miſſe in their deſire, and be never a whit the nearer their point, when they have (as they think) devoured and ſwallowed her down, but will make their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and apparent ſucceſſe to be their ruine, and never to ceaſe till it undo themſelves; for, <hi>Jeruſalem is a cup of trembling,</hi> or, <hi>poiſon,</hi> which is moſt deadly when it is drunk out. 4. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Churches low eſtate, is beſt ſeen, when God, and what he can make out of trouble, is looked unto; otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with fleſh and blood will not diſcover it; for, it is <hi>God who makes Jeruſalem a cup of trembling,</hi> which ſhe could not be of her ſelfe.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The ſame promiſe is repeated in another ſimilitude, taken from mens trying of their ſtrength, in lifting of ſome great and heavy ſtone: The ſumme is, the Church, and eſpecially reſtored <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (for that is <hi>that day</hi> pointed at here, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11.) ſhall be ſo fixed, that whoever would ſeek to remove it, ſhould but break themſelves, even though all the world ſhould conſpire to effectuate it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The promiſes of God concerning the welfare of his Church, are neither eaſily taken up in their fulneſſe, nor believed, and therefore are to be ſtudied over and over again: ſo much doth this repetition of the promiſe teach us. 2. The Church is looked on by enemies in the world, as a troubleſome neighbour, whom they would gladly remove, and be rid of, and they will not ſpare to prove their utmoſt ſtrength, nor care to take on heavie burdens, ſo it may effectuate their purpoſe; for, <hi>Jeruſalem is a ſtone for all people,</hi> which they would have unfixed and removed, and would <hi>burden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> for that end. 3. The Church is ſo eſtabliſhed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, and by vertue of Chriſts charter, and the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God againſt all ſuch as ſeek to moleſt her, is ſo heavie
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169977:103"/>and inſupportable, that all who eſſay to ſhake her, come to ſeek, and do finde their own ruine, while as ſhe remains eſtabliſhed; for, <hi>God will make Jeruſalem a burdenſom ſtone for all people, all that burden themſelves with it ſhall be cut in pieces.</hi> 4. As it is the Churches lot to finde feweſt friends in the world of any ſociety: ſo the multitude and ſtrength of oppoſers can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nothing for carrying on the deſigne of ruining the Church, all the world will effectuate as little, and be as unable to reſiſt the deſerved vengeance, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The ſecond promiſe confirmes and explains the former, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the fountain-cauſe of this diſpenſation toward the Church is, Gods reſtoring them to his favour, from whom he had hid his face ſo long, and his vigilant and affectionate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence over them: and that the way of diſappointing and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining enemies, ſhall be by defeating their wiſdom, counſel and ſtrength, and plaguing every means they employ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There it no wiſdom, counſel nor ſtrength can ſubſiſt where God is Party, and he needs no more, but blow upon all enemies and their meanes, and they will be to ſeek, and run madly and blindly on their own ruine; for, <hi>In that day, ſaith the Lord, I will ſmite every horſe with aſtoniſhment, and his rider with madneſſe, and will ſmite every horſe of the people with blindneſs.</hi> 2. However the Lord may hide his face for a time from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Atheiſme will alwayes be ready to ſay in trouble, that the Lord doth not regard: yet in due time he will prove, that his people are not wronged, but when he hath been a witneſſe and taken notice, that he affects them, and hath an eye upon them; for, <hi>I will open mine eyes upon the houſe of Judah,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 3. The Lords favouring of his people, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and eye upon them, will not conſiſt in bare obſervation, but when he hath marked their wanderings, teares and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169977:103"/>that they are come to an height, his favour and care will ſhine forth in wonderful effects: <hi>I will open mine eyes upon the houſe of Judah, and will ſmite every horſe of the people with blendreſſe.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The third promiſe holds forth the diſpoſition of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as to the uſe of meanes, when the Lord thus appeares for them, and eſpecially of the Governours, who ſhould be the inſtruments of their good. It is promiſed they ſhall have Governours, for directing all their affaires, and managing their wars, and that they ſhall be holy men, not placing their confidence in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men, but every one eſteeming it ſtrength ſufficient that God is reconciled with their ſubjects, and reckoning that theſe, how weak and few ſoever, ſhall be able, through Gods bleſſing to carry through in any difficultie. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a token of great mercy to a people, when the Lord not only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers them from confuſion, and ſettles Rulers over them, but when he makes Rulers really holy and ſtreight for him; for, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> in that day, ſhall have <hi>governours</hi> ſo qualified. 2. It is an evidence of Piety in Rulers, when publick affaires do touch them as near, and are as faithfully ſeen to, as if they were their own particular; for, ſo ſhall every Ruler reckon, that help to the publick is a lift to themſelves, who cordially wraſtle under it; <hi>My ſtrength</hi> ſhall they call it. 3. It is another mark of Piety, when Rulers, beſide their perſonal carriage, ſtudie to advance Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety where they have power, and are encouraged by the growth of Piety, and are encouragements to ſuch as incline that way; for, that ſhall be the Governours refreſhment, that their people are reconciled to God. 4. It is a great evidence of Piety, when any are fully perſwaded of the truths they receive, and generally aſſent to, when truths are not received in a fleeting ſuperficial way, but rooted in the heart, ſo that what they ſay, <hi>they ſay it in their heart.</hi> 5. A people reconciled unto God, are the great ſtrength of a Kingdom or Nation, and they will prove help to it indeed, how contemptible ſoever they ſeem to be; for, ſo ſhall
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169977:104"/>theſe Governours reckon, <hi>The inhabitants of Jeruſalem ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> 6. Whatever good may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of an holy people, is not to be expected from any inherent worth or holineſſe in them, but from Gods free favour toward them, and with much immediate dependance on him, leſt God being deprived of his glory, they be blaſted: therefore is it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly added, <hi>They ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord of hoſtes their God.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The fourth promiſe is the ſame in ſubſtance with the firſt, under another ſimilitude, holding forth, that theſe godly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours ſhould not be diſappointed of their confidence, (of which, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) but they and the people under them ſhould be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, and overcome their enemies, as a furnace conſumes timber, and a torch burnes a ſheaf of dry ſtraw. Which promiſe is further amplified, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thus preſerved, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited again, which that it be not underſtood only ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Church, it is added, that <hi>Jeruſalems own place is even in Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſeems clearly to point at their repoſſeſſing of their land, and of that city, not as being then any more typical, but as being the moſt kindly inheritance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they ſhall be converted as a Nation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Faith and hope in God will never be aſhamed; but theſe who promiſe themſelves much good in God, ſhall finde it ſo; for, <hi>the Governours of Judah,</hi> who expected ſtrength in God, <hi>v.</hi> 5. do get what they expected, <hi>and are made like an hearth of fire, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Enemies of the Church may expect to be deſtroyed by their own aſſaults and enterpriſes againſt her; for their coming to ſmother or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh her, is caſting of <hi>wood upon a hearth,</hi> or, <hi>aſheafe upon a torch of fire,</hi> which puts not out the fire or torch, but burnes themſelves. 3. The deſtruction of ſuch as afflict the Church ſhall not be ordinary, but violent, total and irrecoverable; for,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169977:104"/>
                     <hi>as fire and a torch, they ſhall devoure all the people round about, on the right hand, and on the left,</hi> which doth not point at the Churches cruelty, but at the way of enemies being ruined. 4. No oppoſition made unto the Church, will be able to make any promiſes given unto her, or gracious purpoſes of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her, ineffectual; for, notwithſtanding all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or warres and troubles they may be put to, yet, <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſhall be inhabited again, in her own place, even in Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The fifth promiſe holds forth eſpecially Gods method, in bringing about this promiſed ſalvation and help, that the weak villages in the countrey ſhould get the firſt proof of his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſo God may have the glory of ſaving them, and ſuch as have either power or prudence, (as a walled town, and great Rulers) may have no cauſe to glory of any excellencie in them above others, to make themſelves happy. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

The Lord will ſo have a care of all his people, as, however he ſee meet to humble ſome of them at ſome times, and to delay his help till they be humbled, yet it is not his purpoſe to deny them altogether, therefore is the promiſe made particularly to the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, to ſhew that however he would prefer <hi>Judab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lords protection is the ſure ſafe-guard of his Church, beyond any thing they get ſtrength to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yea, it is the ſtrength of their ſtrength, to abide under his ſhadow with it; therefore is the promiſe of defence premit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that of their ſtrength, as being their ſure refuge, and that which makes them ſtrong; <hi>The Lord will defend Jeruſalem, &amp; he that is feeble ſhall be as David. &amp;c.</hi> 3. However the Lord may keep his people in a low &amp; weak condition for their exerciſe, yet he hath undertaken to let out proofes of his ſtrength in them, in a time of need, in a ſingular way, and will make their weakneſſe in themſelves a preſage of their being ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in him: <hi>He that is feeble among them, at that day ſhall be as David.</hi> 4. None do attaine in this life to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169977:105"/>that meaſure of ſtrength and courage, but they do yet ſtand in need of more, and ought to be on the growing hand: for, <hi>the houſe of David</hi> needs a promiſe of this, as well as the feeble. 5. As Chriſt will be unto his Church in her need, whatever he hath been unto her at any time; ſo what Chriſt is, that are believers in him their Head, as they need it, all fulneſſe dwelling in him for their behoof: for, as Chriſt had been <hi>as on Angel of God before that people,</hi> ſo will he be yet, <hi>and the houſe of David ſo</hi> in him.</p>

                  <p>In the eighth promiſe, is held forth the future converſion and repentance of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the full accompliſhment whereof was not that which we read in the primitive times, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. but is yet to be accompliſhed, when all their families ſhall concur in this work, <hi>v.</hi> 14. which was not then fulfilled. The Lord promiſeth unto the body of that people. that he will give unto them the Spirit of converſion and prayer, to help down their enemies, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for their piercing of Chriſt, by conſenting to their fathers deed, and by their reproaches againſt Chriſt and all Chriſtians for his ſake, during the time of their infidelity: and that this ſorrow ſhall be ſincere and vehement, as for an only ſon, or a firſt-borne. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Prayer is a ſpecial and effectual means of bringing down the Churches enemies: for, in that day that he ſeeks to deſtroy enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 9. this promiſe goeth along, <hi>And I will poure upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of grace and of ſupplications.</hi> 2. Prayer for bringing down enemies is not the work of received habits and qualifications only, but muſt flow from the Spirit of God, who where he is given to any, is the gift of Gods free grace and favour, a pledge and worker of grace in them, and an aſſured token of Gods favour to them; for there is <hi>a Spi it of ſupplications,</hi> who alſo, being given for that end, <hi>is the Spirit of grace.</hi> 3. As all that any do by way of duty, in promoving their own happineſſe, is but the fruit of Gods preventing grace, ſo are his diſpenſations of grace ample and liberal, like to the giver: for, when they ſupplicate, it is, becauſe he furniſheth them by his Spirit ſo to do; and this Spirit <hi>is poured</hi> out in large meaſure. 4. It is not enough in times of ſtrait, to ſupplicate God for help out of trouble, but guilt ought to be our greateſt burden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and repentance for it joyned with our prayers: for, when they have <hi>the Spirit of ſupplications,</hi> they <hi>ſhall mourn.</hi> 5. Sin will then affect the heart moſt, when the wrong done to Chriſt by it is ſtudied, and eſpecially a true penitent will be moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with any perſecution of Chriſt in his members, whereof he hath been guilty: for ſo will it be with the converted Jewes, <hi>They ſhall look on me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn.</hi> 6. A true penitent will be eaſily convinced, and will
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169977:106"/>take with the guilt of that which they have been approvers of conſenters, and upſtirrers into, though others have acted it; for, the Jews will then reckon that <hi>they pierced Chriſt,</hi> though it was done by the hand of the <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldiers: yea, their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhall take with it, becauſe of their conſent to what their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did. 7. Repentance for ſinne flowes from faith in Chriſt, and the faith of our intereſt in his ſufferings, for, ſaith Chriſt (who being God from eternity, doth here ſpeak) <hi>They ſhall look upon me whom they have piered, and mourne,</hi> which imports not only their conſidering that their fathers with wicked hands pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but their looking to him by faith; (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of old to the brazen ſerpent, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.8, 9.) as pierced for, and by their ſinnes, even though they were ſuch enemies, to purchaſe reconciliation for them, which will draw forth repentance. 8. As acceptable repentance for ſinne ought to be ſincere and reall without diſſimulation, ſo kindly ſorrow for it will come behinde no ſorrow for any prejudice whatſoever: though ſometimes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſorrow may fall ſhort in outward expreſſion, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, and ſo great, that to get it expreſſed were an eaſe; for, <hi>They ſhall mourn for him,</hi> (where the perſon is changed, God the Father ſpeaking, or the Prophet in his name) <hi>as one mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his only ſonne, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>It is further declared concerning this repentance, that it ſhall be univerſal among all the people, and all ranks, and that not only in a publick way, but alſo by private humiliations in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, of Rulers, and Teachers, who had been chief in the guilt of crucifying Chriſt, and of all other ranks, who ſhould in their mourning ſhut up themſelves from their wives, and other lawfull delights, as was the cuſtome of the Jewes in mourning. The Rulers are ſignified by <hi>the houſe of David,</hi> and <hi>of Nathan</hi> a ſonne of <hi>Davids,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.14. whoſe poſterity it ſeems, were in ſome eminency in this time: and the teachers are ſignified, by <hi>the houſe of Levi</hi> and <hi>of Shimei</hi> a ſonne of <hi>Gerſhom</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Lovi,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.17. whoſe poſterity alſo ſeems to have been ſome way remarkable in <hi>Zechariabs</hi> time, and therefore particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly poken of. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The converſion of the Jewes or <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto the Meſſiah, is not to be of ſome few only, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

True pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents will not ſatisfie himſelves only with publick humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where cuſtome and example may draw many; but will alſo make conſcience of the duty in families, and where no eye

As the Lord will have his own among emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Rulers, ſo it is a deſirable bleſſing, when Rulers and Teachers, who ordinarily have chief hand in publick provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do not draw back, but are eminent in the duty of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for, ſo is here promiſed, <hi>The family of the houſe of David, of Nathan, of Levi, of Shimei, ſhall mourne.</hi> 4. In ſetting about the duty of repentance and humiliations, perſons are not only to caſt off ſinfull diſtractions, but even to lay aſide lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that they may afflict their ſouls before the Lord, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly minde the duty; for, <hi>The families ſhall mourn, and their wives apart.</hi>

                     <p>IN that day there ſhall be a fountain opened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin, and for uncleanneſs.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>There are ſeveral bleſſings and benefits of the Kingdome of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169977:108"/>Chriſt here promiſed, which as the godly Jewes before Chriſt did enjoy, though more darkly and in leſſer meaſure then under the Goſpel: ſo though they be the common priviledges of the Goſpel-Church, in every age, yet a more full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them is reſerved for the converted <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are peculiarly promiſed for <hi>that day</hi> when they ſhall repent and be reſtored, as appears from the end of the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The firſt benefit is, Remiſſion of ſinnes and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, purging away the guilt of ſinne, by the grace of God in for giving ſinnes through Chriſts blood, and the vertue of his blood applied by the Spirit, and laid hold upon by faith, for purging all uncleanneſſe of ſinne: this is compared to a ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountaine made open to all, in oppoſition to the ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of water carried into the Temple for legall waſhings. This benefit will be very conſpicuous toward converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>the Redeemer ſhall turne iniquity from Jacob, Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The great and chiefe priviledge of the Goſpel is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and purging of ſinne, which as they are only attainable through faith laying hold on Chriſts blood, and the grace of God through him offered in the Goſpel, ſo without theſe no other advantages by the Goſpel will availe much, or be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; for, it is the firſt here, <hi>A fountaine for ſinne, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,</hi> or, <hi>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cration through uncleanneſſe,</hi> pointing at all filthineſſe of ſinne, ſhadowed out by legall uncleanneſſe, cauſing men to be ſequeſtrate; and particularly at originall ſinne, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by menſtruous uncleanneſſe, for the purging where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this fountaine alſo muſt be made uſe of. 2. The free grace of God toward loſt man, and the vertue of Chriſts blood is a treaſure in exhauſtible, and which cannot be overcome with the greatneſſe and multiplicity of ſinne in theſe who flee unto it; for, it is <hi>a fountain,</hi> or <hi>ſpring</hi> 3. Pardon, and vertue for purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſinne is not only purchaſed, and the way to it made pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, by the death of Chriſt, giving acceſſe unto God through him: but is held forth in the offer of the Goſpel and Miniſtery of the Word, that none may pretend ignorance, nor any who need it ſeclude themſelves from ſo free an offer; and that the godly who have found the fruit of it, may come and daily make uſe of it: for, it is <hi>à fountaine opened.</hi> 4. As the greateſt muſt be in Chriſts reverence for this benefit, even theſe who have greateſt gifts and are Rulers of others; ſo the meaneſt in the Church, however they be not equal to others in gifts, yet
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169977:108"/>have a like intereſt with them in this ſaving benefit; for, it is <hi>opened to the houſe of David,</hi> or, Rulers who attend in Chriſts Courts, <hi>and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem,</hi> or body of the Church. 5. When the Lord poures out upon his people, the Spirit of repentance and humiliation, it is a forerunner of ample manifeſtations of the grace of God, in opening up the treaſures of the Goſpel by the Miniſtery of the Word, and in granting of pardon, and growth in purity; for, when <hi>the land ſhall mourn,</hi> Chap. 12.10. <hi>In that day, there ſhall be a fountaine opened.</hi>

                     <p>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, ſaith the LORD of hoſts, <hi>that</hi> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they ſhall no more be remembred: and alſo I will cauſe the Prophets, and the unclean ſpirit to paſſe out of the land.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>A ſecond benefit promiſed, is, Reformation of the Church from all ſuperſtition, idolatry, and corruption in worſhip, under the name of <hi>Idols,</hi> and from falſe Doctrine in removing of falſe teachers, and the unclean ſpirit that leads and acts them: This is accompliſhed in every reformed Church, by Doctrine and conſtitutions of Diſcipline according to the meaſure of their Reformation, but will more eſpecially appear in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they are converted and reſtored. The Doctrine and Diſcipline of that Church ſhall caſt out all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Sectaries, and Schiſmaticks out of the land. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Goſpel-Reformation conſiſts not only in the internall purging away of ſinne, but in the outward Reformation of Doctrine alſo, whereby Gods truth, and Ordinances, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be with, and to bleſſe for converſion and renovation of ſouls, are eſtabliſhed and ſet up; for here, with the fountaine opened, ſuch a Reformation is promiſed. 2. The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church is promoved and carried on, eſpecially when the Spirit of repentance for ſinne, and former deboardings from God is poured out upon a people; for, this Reformation goeth on <hi>in that day,</hi> when they are mourning, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. The neglect of this provokes God to reforme his Church rather by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:169977:109"/>then by ſuch a merciful way. 3. Every corruption in the worſhip of God is an idol, in ſo farre as it is a device of mans own brain, and the deviſer imagineth to himſelfe a God, who will not approve of ſuch worſhip, which certainly is not the true God: ſo it is here held out, <hi>I will cut off Idols.</hi> 4. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and ſuperſtition are ſo grievous in the eyes of a jealous God, ſo ſcandalous blemiſhes in his bride, and evils to which we have ſuch an inclination by nature, as the leaſt mixture of theſe with his worſhip cannot but diſhonour God, and pollute the Church; and the very memorial of them, will be enough to draw us back to Apoſtaſie; therefore in a right Reformation, <hi>The names of idols are to be cut off, and to be no more remembred,</hi> to wit, in any religious ſtate eſpecially. 5. Whatever falſe worſhip may ſeem to be, or promiſe, yet in effect it proves but matter of terrour and ſorrow, when the worſhipper ſtands in greateſt need of comfort in his worſhip; for, ſo doth the name of <hi>idols</hi> (which in the Original is ſorrowes, or, terrours) import. 6. Purity of worſhip and Doctrine muſt go together, all corrupt worſhip having falſe Doctrine at the root of it; and as corruption in worſhip uſhers in hereſie in Doctrine, ſo unſoundneſſe in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine flowing from an unſound heart, cannot conſiſt with pare and acceptable worſhip; for here, <hi>idols</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> or teachers of falſe Doctrine (who are here deſigned as they uſe to deſigne themſelves) muſt go together. 7. Approven Reformation doth not only oppoſe the error by way of doctrinal declaration and refutation, but alſo the teacher of the error, by way of Diſcipline; for, where Doctrine is reformed, <hi>The Prophet paſſeth out of the land.</hi> 8. Falſe Doctrine and corrupt worſhip are accompliſhed with, and flow from, not only the polluted and corrupt heart and imaginations of men, but from a ſpirit of Satan, the father of lies, who contributes to make them have place in the world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them who receive not the love of the truth; which ſpirit, how plauſible ſoever, is not an harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and innocent ſpirit, but an unclean ſpirit, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the vileſt affections in men, to hatch and broach error, and oftentimes leading the erroneous perſon into blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in converſation, that in Gods wiſdom the veile may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off their way; for, with the <hi>Prophet,</hi> there is <hi>an unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to paſſe out of the land</hi> in a time of Reformation. Hence it is that errors are called <hi>the error of the wicked,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. and <hi>are works of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.19, 20. and work on luſts and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169977:109"/>wantonneſſe, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18 See, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. 9. It is the Lord who hath chief hand in the Churches Reformation, and to whom the glory thereof is due: it is he who preſcribes the rule of Reformation, who cleares it up from his Word unto a people, who ſtirres them up to embrace it, and who by his Spirit makes it effectuall, notwithſtanding all oppoſition; for, <hi>In that day, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I will cut off the names of idols, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A third benefit (which is a branch of the former,) is zeal in the godly againſt falſe teachers, who ſhall be ſo tender, of the truth and glory of God, and the ſafety of the Church, (all which are endangered by error,) that it ſhall overcome natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them; ſo that parents ſhall not ſpare their own children, being ſeducers, but ſhall either by an heroick act (ſuch as was in <hi>Phinchas, Numb.</hi> 25.8.) themſelves judge him worthy to die, and give ſentence and execute it, or cauſe him to be puniſhed, by bringing him to the Magiſtrate who hath power, according to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. It is here promiſed, that this zeal ſhall be conſpicuous in converted <hi>Iſrael. Doct.</hi> 1. Times of through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reformation, will not want their own meaſure of oppoſition by ſome adhering unto, and perſevering in their old corruptions; yea, it is ordinary, that in a time of Reformation, Satan will be let looſe in falſe teachers, as intending thereby to ſcandalize all Reformation, but God intending hereby to make Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more pure, and truth the clearer becauſe of oppoſition; for, when God is reforming, there will be <hi>who ſhall yet propheſie.</hi> 2. The toleration of a falſe Religion in Doctrine or worſhip, and the exemption of the erroneous from civil puniſhment, is no more lawful under the New Teſtament, then it was under the Old, it being no more lawfull to compell conſciences (if ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be that this be a compulſion, as men give it out) then, nor it is now; for, here is a Prophecie of the dayes of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169977:110"/>alluding to the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5, 6, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being then to be in force. 3. The Lords promiſing and undertaking a work of Reformation, and the ſuppreſſing of error and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ought to be no hindrance to Magiſtrates and others in their ſtations, to ſuppreſſe what may hinder Reformaton, but rather an encouragement unto them, having ſuch ground of hope that their endeavours ſhall be ſucceſſefull; for, though God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to bring about this Reformation, <hi>v.</hi> 2. yet it is foretold that they ſhall do their duty, <hi>v.</hi> 3. A Magiſtrates duty is no more inconſiſtent with the promiſe that Reformation ſhall be Gods work, then Miniſters preaching againſt error is, both of them being means whereby God accompliſheth his promiſe. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that all erroneous perſons ſtand guilty before the Lord, yet his controverſie is ſpecially againſt ſeducers and falſe teachers, unto whom puniſhment is ſpecially due from the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for it is, <hi>They who propheſie,</hi> that are to be puniſhed. 5. Zeal for God is very lawfully and warrantably imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt error, as well as againſt prophanity; and deareſt relations and natural affections ought to give place unto it, it being cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſuffer theſe we affect to loſe their own ſouls, and the ſouls of others; for, <hi>When any ſhall yet propheſie, then his father and his mother that begat him, ſhall ſay unto him, thou ſhalt not live.</hi> 6. It is not enough nor a ſufficient teſtimony of zeal in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, to ſuppreſſe and puniſh erroneous perſons, when they do by their Doctrine and practices diſturb the civil peace of the State, but their wronging of the truth of God, corrupting of ſouls food, poiſoning them with lies inſtead of truth, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the God of truth by fathering of a lie upon him, ought to ſtirre up zeal to take order with them; for, this is the reaſon of the ſentence, <hi>Thou ſhalt not live, for thou ſpeakeſt lies in the Name of the Lord.</hi> 7. Some errors are ſo eminently blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and ſome perſons ſo eminently engaged in venting and promoting of them; as in Gods account, calls for the death of the ſeducers; for of ſome Prophers and Prophecies it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not live, and they ſhall thruſt him through.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A fourth benefit, flowing from the two former of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and zeal of the godly, appears upon ſome of ſeducers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who through the clearneſſe and abundance of the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and of knowledge, and obſerving the ſeverity uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome, ſhal be convinced in conſcience of the error of their way, and ſhall willingly ceaſe from deceiving the people, and from their accuſtomed counterfeiting of holineſſe, they ſhall lay aſide the habit uſed by true Prophets in ſigne of ſobriety, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.4. whereby they had deluded the people, and they ſhall renounce the Profeſſion, and take them to their wonted callings, which they had left to turn deceivers, and to live idly. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. How ſtrong and taking ſoever errour be, yet truth is infinitely ſtronger, and can prevaile over it, and convince and confound the greateſt oppoſite that ever he ſhould have been againſt it; for, <hi>In that day the Prophets ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, every one of his viſion, when he hath propheſied.</hi> 2. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and erroneous wayes, are not to be lightly, and without remorſe abandoned, (as if it were but a change of judgement,) but with deep conviction of conſcience, and ſhame of face, as for other ſcandalous ſins; for, <hi>the Phophets ſhall he aſhamed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his viſion.</hi> 3. Civil powers, their ſuppreſſing and puniſhing erroneous perſons and ſeducers, is not a meanes to make men turn hypocrites: but being joyned with due convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, may be bleſſed with reclaiming of them indeed; for, this conviction renouncing hypocritical ſhewes, and acknowledging their errour, ſpeaks ſo much at leaſt in ſome of them. 4. As it is uſual for Satan and falſe teachers to delude the world, under faireſt pretexts of holineſſe and mortification; ſo it ſhall adde to the conviction and repentance of the truly convinced, that they have covered ſo vile a courſe with ſo faire a vaile; for, as <hi>they did wear a rough garment to deceive,</hi> ſo they ſhall not do it any more when they are convinced. 5. When God convinceth and wakeneth the conſciences of ſeducers, and of unfaithful teachers, it will be ſad and grievous unto them, that they did run without a calling, and did undertake a charge, for which they were not fitted, and they will be ready to ſubſcribe to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169977:111"/>their own ſenrence and ejection; for, <hi>they ſhall ſay, I am no Prophet, I am an Husbandman:</hi> imports not only that they ſhall be convinced, that they wanted a calling to that office, but that they ſhall judge themſelves more fit for the Plough then the Pulpit. 6. As it is a great iniquity for men whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath ſettled in a lawful calling, to leave it, and at their own hand turn teachers, and as this is the means to breed many errors in a Church, when all the Congregation will be holy, and think that teachers take too much upon them: ſo a chiefe cauſe why men turne and continue ſeducers and falſe teachers, is unwillingneſſe to be at pains for their livelihood in a lawful calling, which they think to gaine more eaſily that way: this is it which makes <hi>Husbandmen, bred to keep cat el from their youth,</hi> quit their calling, and pretend to propheſying, which as it made many teachers of lies, ſo they will ſee it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it to be a great ſin, when God ſpeaks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </q>
                  <p>This benefit and effect upon falſe teachers is further declared, in that they ſhall not only relinquiſh their deceiving, and take them to their old employment, but when any ſhall enquire what the prints of inferiour chaſtiſements, that had been inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them who eſcaped death, meane, (which however they might be hid on the reſt of their body, yet were viſible on their maked hands) They ſhall juſtifie the cenſure, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the inflicters, (whether their Parents, <hi>v.</hi> 3. or Judges,) were friends and not enemies. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That the Spirit of God is not here propheſying of ſpiritual cenſures, and the Churches piercing of ſeducers with threatenings of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wrath, but is foretelling of civil corporal puniſhments, is clear from this Scripture; for, there will be <hi>wounds in the bands,</hi> which are viſible, and occaſion queſtions from others. 2. It is not the Will of God that all errors be alike ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, nor all ſeducers puniſhed alike, but that the puniſhment be proportioned to the error, and to mens obſtinacy in main

                  <p>The Lord having foretold this happineſſe to come upon the Church, eſpecially on converted <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and leſt the godly ſhould over-rejoyce becauſe of this dream of a conſtant gale of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: therfore he ſubjoyns a prophecie of the ſufferings of Chriſt, the afflictions of the godly, and the purging of the viſibie Church by judgements, ere all this Reformation, eſpecially of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were brought about. This prophecie hath its chief and firſt accompliſhment in Chriſts perſon, his diſciples, and the viſible Church of the Jewes after his death, but may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended alſo to point out the lot of Paſtors, and particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church in all ages.</p>
                  <p>In this part of the prophecie, Chriſts ſufferings are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, in a charge given to affliction or perſecution, (ſignified by the ſword) to aſſaile and ſmite Chriſt for the ſins of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to the paction paſt in the Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Upon which it is foretold, that the flock ſhall be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, (whereof an external ſymbole was the flight of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.31. but was more fully accompliſhed in the diſperſion of the Jewes after his death,) and that in that ſcattering God would have a care of his own, who are little in their own eyes, would preſerve them, and change his dealing toward them, as was verified in his recollecting and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169977:112"/>ſtrengthening his ſcattered diſciples, and preſerving of his own among the Jewes. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Church of Chriſt is not to dream of flouriſhing and trivmphing dayes, but to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for what is promiſed her by trouble, and to have them ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned when they come with trouble; ſo much doth the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of former promiſes, with theſe predictions of the ſuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt and his ſervants, as if they were falſe teachers, import. 2. It is no ſufficient argument to hinder the Church and Chriſtian Magiſtrates zeal in puniſhing errour, that the faithful ſervants of Chriſt are oft-times under perſecution for truth, the one being the Churches duty, which may not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without ſin; the other, her affliction only; for, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the leſſe a mercy to have falſe prophets <hi>thruſt through, v.</hi> 3. that ſometime the ſword is drawn againſt Chriſt and his followers. 3. Chriſt incarnate is the good and faithful ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of his flock, who willingly gave his life for his ſheep, who was obedient to his Father unto death, ſerved him in the work of Redemption, and who in his office is approved and accepted of him, and loſt none of his Fathers reſpects by his afflictions; for, the Father acknowledges him <hi>my ſhepherd.</hi> 4. Chriſt in one perſon is both God and man, being true man as incarnate, and true God in his divine nature dwelling by the perſonal union in the humane nature, equal with the Father, becauſe of the ſame eſſence, though in reſpect of his office and voluntary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, he be inferiour; for, he is <hi>the man that is my fellow, equal,</hi> or <hi>companion, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 5. The ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, (and conſequently of all his followers) are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled by the effectual Providence of God, ſo that nothing is done to him without the Fathers conſent, who yet is free of the ſins of all inſtruments employed in afflicting him, who were about another thing in that work then the Father approved of: for, it is God who commands <hi>the ſword to awake, and ſmite the ſhepherd.</hi> 6. Chriſt is the Chieftain and Ring-leader of all the Churches fuflerers, who in his own perſon hath paved the way to his followers, and tried the ſwords, and who by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and ſympathie, chiefly ſuffers in the ſufferings of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for, the ſword aſſayes him firſt, <hi>Smite the ſhepherd.</hi> 7. When the Lord ſends troubles upon the viſible Church, the Paſtors and Watchmen are to reſolve for hardeſt meaſure, as being Satans greateſt eye-ſores, and they who ought to confirm others by their ſufferings; for, as this was verified in Chriſt,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169977:112"/>ſo alſo at other times trouble ordinarily begins at <hi>Smite the ſhepherd.</hi> 8. Trouble is a very terrifying thing when it comes to a pinch, and may affright thoſe who thought themſelves very ſtout, and make them ſhrink if there be any way to ſhun it; for, ſo did appear in the accompliſhment of this prophecie, in the diſciples flight. 9. Albeit it be Satans policie to cauſe men to undervalue Paſtors, and look upon them as burdens, which the Church would be the better to want; yet their trouble progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticates trouble to come on the Church, their death, exile or impriſonment ſcatters the viſible ſociety of the Church; for, this is of eternal verity, as well as in the diſciples flight; <hi>Smite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered.</hi> 10. It is an eſpecial preſage of the Churches ſcattering by the loſſe of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, when they themſelves have an hand in the perſecuting of Paſtors; for, ſo was this accompliſhed on the Church of the Jewes, they ſmote Chriſt who was their ſhepherd, and therefore were juſtly ſcattered themſelves. 11. Saddeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions do not ſeclude the elect and faithful from Chriſt and his Fathers care, but that he will moderate and change his dealing toward them, when afflictions are univerſal and ſore; for, as while Chriſt was ſuffering in his humane nature, he ceaſed not to work in his divine nature, and to care for his own diſciples and followers: ſo in all ages he (being raiſed from the dead) and his Father with him, <hi>doth turne his hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the little ones,</hi> or give them a renewed proof of his love, in recovering them after their ſcattering, and in preſerving them by his tender care under common calamities, after they had been left to themſelvs to get a proof of their own frailty. 12. It is an evidence of Chriſts flock, and of theſe that he cares for in trouble, that they are humble and little in their own eyes, and that their afflictions contribute to make them ſo more and more; for, they are <hi>the little ones.</hi>

                  <p>In this next part of the Prophecie, we have the further expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the flocks ſcattering, in reſpect of the ſeveral ſorts of diſpoſitions in it, there being a generality (ſignified by two parts,) who are ordinarily naught, theſe are to be cut off and deſtroyed, and only a remnant, or <hi>third part</hi> left, who yet ſhould not be free of affliction to purge away their droſſe, that they may be more fervent in Gods ſervice, and in getting prooſs of Gods hearing their prayers, and of his love intimated unto them, they may increaſe in faith and confidence. This was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, not only on the Nation of the Jewes, but in all ages is to be ſeen in the viſible Church, when he ſets up his fire in it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the viſible Church is for ordinary ſo mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that the generality thereof is unſound, and not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their obligations: ſo it is righteous with God, to ſend trials and judgements upon her, whereby he purgeth her of ſuch droſſe, and cuts them off, who living in his houſe, will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his yoke; for, <hi>in all the land, two parts ſhall be cut off, and die.</hi> 2. In times of Gods ſaddeſt judgements upon the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, as God will have a ſpecial care of his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo uſeth he to preſerve a remnant toward whom to ſhew mercy; for, <hi>the third part ſhall be left therein.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lord reſerve a remnant to himſelf, yet he will not alwayes free them from taſting of ſo much affliction and calamity as may exerciſe them; for, <hi>I will bring the third part through the fire.</hi> 4. The Lords end in letting our affliction upon his own is not to deſtroy them, but to give them a proof of themſelves, and to purge them from their droſſe, and make them better, and by this teſtifie his eſtimation of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>I will refine them as ſilver is refined, and try tham as gold is tried.</hi> The meaning of which ſimilitude is not, that they ſhall be purged from all their droſſe, or, that they can abide ſuch a ſurnace, as ſilver or gold <hi>Iſa</hi> 4.10. but that (as theſe precious mettals) they have ſome droſſe, which cannot be diſcovered or purged but by ſome ſearching trialls: that they ſhall not prove chaſſe, ſtubble or droſſe in the furnace, but have ſome mettal, which ſhall be preſerved and ſhine the brighter; and that God by taking this
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169977:113"/>pains on them, declares that he accounts them his treaſure, and precious mettal. 5. It is a ſweet evidence of a peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting under the rod, and being purged of droſſe, when their zeal in Gods worſhip, their need of him, and delight in calling on his Name, is encreaſed; for <hi>they ſhall call on my Name.</hi> 6. When the Lord bleſſeth his people with fruitfulneſſe under affliction, and puts them to employ him much; it is a pledge that God will heare their prayers, and ſhed abroad the ſenſe of his love in their hearts, aſſuring them of an intereſt in him; for, <hi>I will hear them, I will ſay, It is my people.</hi> 7. As fait, and the increaſe of it, enabling men boldly to proſeſſe it before God and the world, is a choice Goſpel-bleſſing, and a rich recompence of much affliction: ſo Gods preventing grace and kindneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his people when they ſeek him, eſpecially under affliction, is ſuch, as may invite them to make him their portion, and give them warrant, confidently to reſt and relie on him; for, upon his <hi>hearing,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>It is my people, they ſhall ſay, The Lord is my God.</hi>

                  <p>The chapter begins with a more clear prediction of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> then before, wherein God being Judge and Avenger of his Sons blood which they ſhould ſhed, would bring a day of ſpecial vengeance upon that city, putting it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the power of enemies, who, without fear of ambuſh or ſurpriſal, ſhould divide the ſpoiles of the city in the midſt of lt: and by this doctrine he cleareth what had been ſaid, <hi>chap.</hi> 13.8. of cutting off two parts, and leaving a third part. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the Churches advantage to be ordinarily warned of a ſtroak before it come, that ſhe wiſely conſidering Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may labour to prevent or prepare for it; that the godly be not ſurprized with ſuch a judgement when it comes; and that God may be juſtified, if he make them feel juſtice, who will not believe truth ſpeaking it; therefore are they excited to conſider this approaching judgement; <hi>Behold, the day cometh.</hi> 2. The Lord is chief and ſupreme in all the Churches calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he it is who executeth his Word by them, who pleads his controverſies, and who, however he be but little ſeen or regarded in the viſible Church, yet by his judgements will be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Lord; for, <hi>the day of the Lord cometh.</hi> 3. It is one evidence of divine diſpleaſure, wherein God is to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169977:114"/>be ſeen, when enemies get power over the ſubſtance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (in purſuing after which God is oft-times forgotten) and do without fear of any, diſpoſe thereof at their pleaſure; for, it is <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> wherein he is ſeen, when <hi>the ſpoil ſhall be divided in the midſt of thee.</hi>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>For I will gather all Nations against Jeruſalem to battel, and the city ſhall be taken, and the houſes rifled, and the women raviſhed, and halfe of the city ſhall go forth into captivity, and the reſidue of the people ſhall not be cut off from the city.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This calamity is further deſcribed, from both the ſeverity and moderation that ſhall be in it. The Lord was to gather the Romane army, (conſiſting of many Nations, ſubject unto them, and confederate with them) againſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and to deliver the city into their hands, that houſes might be pillaged, and women raviſhed; and yet he would not utterly deſtroy that Nation, for ſome of them ſhould be preſerved by going into captivity, and others ſhould leave it before the time of the ſiege, (as the Chriſtians who went to <hi>Pella</hi>) and ſo ſhould not be cut off from the city, or from that Nation, whereof the city was a part. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is not a motion or enterpriſe among men in the world, eſpecially about the Church, but Grd hath a ſovereign hand in it, and is by them carrying on purpoſes which they little minde; for the Romane armies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is Gods deed to avenge his Sons death; <hi>I will gather all Nations againſt Jeruſalem to battel.</hi> 2. As the Lord hath not a few, but all Nations at his command, to put them in ſubjection to whom he will, and to be employed as he pleaſeth: ſo many of them are employed againſt the Church, that he may bring many witneſſes to the pleading of his contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and may diſcover to her her folly, in provoking him to give her into the hands of theſe who formerly hated her, but could not prevaile becauſe of his protection; for, <hi>all Nations</hi> are put under the Romanes by him, and <hi>gathered againſt Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> 3. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee enemies prevail againſt the Church, when God is purſuing a controverſie with her; nor,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169977:115"/>when ſhe rejects Chriſt corrupts his worſhip, ſheds righteous blood, is given to covetouſneſſe, injuſtice, Iuxury, &amp;c. and is obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in all theſe, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fore other Churches may expect the ſame meaſure, if they provoke God, and being under calamitie, are to be thankful in ſo far as they come ſhort of this ſtroak. 4. Every one ought to ſubmit and prepare for what God may carve out as their ſhare of a common calamity, according as in his wiſdom he thinks fit, without complaining of being otherwiſe dealt with then others: for, the city being taken, there is death (of which no mention is made here) <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling of houſes, captivity,</hi> and (which is worſe then death) <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing of women,</hi> when husbands and parents are not able to defend their wives and children, of which ſome taſted of one, ſome of more, as God ſaw fit. 5. The Lord can ſo ſeaſon ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt diſpenſations to his people, and ſet bounds to over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trouble, as even when they ſeem bittereſt, ſome mercy may be in the boſome of them; for, not only was this fatal ſtroak a mercy, in that it was a clear demonſtration that the Meſſiah was come, in that their Common-wealth was quite aboliſhed, and their Ceremonial worſhip put to a cloſe, the Temple being deſtroyed: but yet further mercy appears, in that that Nation is not quite cut off, but a part reſerved for future mercy; <hi>a refidue not cut off from the city.</hi> Which as it was literally true in <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> invaſion before Chriſt, that ſome were left in the city, ſo under the Romanes, ſome of that Nation and City eſcaped the ſiege and theſe calamities. 6. The Lord may conveigh pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of mercy in a ſad time, through very ſad diſpenſations, which at firſt view would ſeem to promiſe no ſuch thing; for, as this mercy of being preſerved, was granted to ſome in eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ſiege, ſo others were reſerved to be a ſeed of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their captivity into ſtrange Nations: <hi>Halfe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall go forth into captivity,</hi> is both a calamity, and yet a mercy to that Nation.</p>

Albeit the Lord by his ſecret Providence do ſo order affaires, as that the Churches enemies do nothing but execute his quarrel; yet they are to expect no thanks for their ſervice againſt his Church, as minding nothing leſſe therein then the execution of Gods will, but they may rather reckon that they are permitted to go on in that ſervice to ripen them for vengeance; for, though the Lord <hi>gathered</hi> them, <hi>v.</hi> 2. yet now, <hi>he will fight againſt them</hi> 3. The Churches low eſtate may be a time of greater mercies, at leaſt as to his reckoning with her enemies, then when ſhe is moſt flouriſhing; for, <hi>then,</hi> when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is deſtroyed, albeit he do not yet reſtore them, yet <hi>he will go forth and fight againſt their enemies.</hi> 4. All the Churches experiences in former times, are forth-coming for the Churches comfort in after-ages, according as ſhe ſhall need them, and as the Lords wiſdom ſeeth fit to improve them; for, <hi>he ſhall fight as when he fought in the day of battel,</hi> which is not to be reſtricted to any one particular experience or time, but generally to be underſtood of all or any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which may ſeeme moſt comfortable in this or that ſtrait.</p>

                  <p>A ſecond queſtion might ariſe upon the hearing of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; what ſhould become of the Church, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is gone, the Temple burnt, and that Nation cut off or ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered? To which, anſwer is given, that the Church ſhould not periſh, for God ſhould reveal the doctrine of ſalvation, and make a plain way for the Gentiles to come unto the Church in place of the Jewes, and to worſhip him according to his will from afar off. Thus do I take up this dark ſpeech, without troubling my ſelf with other expoſitions: for the clearing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, conſider, that the City <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ruſalem</hi> was encompaſſed with hills, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 125.2. (whereof this Mount of Olives was one,) ſo that it was not ſeen afar off, nor the way to it eaſie. Whe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by was ſignified, that under the Law, the Church and way to heaven was hid up from the reſt of the world, being not only dark to the Jewes in reſpect of many ceremonies, but theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were a partition-wall, betwixt the Gentiles and the Church; ſo that the turning of that hill into a plaine valley, imports, that God ſhould make the Church, and way of his worſhip clear to them afar off, that they might look there-away, as of old they did to the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. (teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying their worſhipping God, as he had preſcribed and revealed himſelf,) and that he would remove impediments in the way of their Converſion, and make a plain way without ceremonies for them to come unto the Church. In this dark ſpeech the Mount of Olives is only mentioned, though there were other hills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe of an external ſymbole of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, accompliſhed on that Mount; when Chriſt aſcending into heaven from off this Mount, gave Commiſſion to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to carry the Goſpel into all parts of the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8, — 12. and upon his Aſcenſion poured out his Spirit, and ſo, did make the Church notor, and the way to it conſpicuous and eaſie through the world. As for the valleyes lying Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Weſtward, and the parts of the cleft Mount going to the North and the South, it is not curioufly to be dipped in; for the parts of it were to go ſomewhere, and it may be thus conceived, that through all the world, (the large extent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ordinarily taken up from Eaſt to Weſt, <hi>Pſal:</hi> 103.12
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169977:116"/>and 113.3.) the Church ſhall be conſpicuous, or rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the City lay to the Weſt of the Mount, the two parts of it bendved to go that way to North and South, and not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelme the city, which would overturn the ſcope of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. No commotions and overturnings in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, will deprive Chriſt of a Church and people, he will finde a way to get a people amongſt theſe who are little thought of, when theſe who account themſelves the children of the Kingdom are caſt out, for ſo are we taught here. 2. The opening up of the way of ſalvation, is God and Chriſts owne work, who by his preventing power and grace, overturnes moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of impediments, to bring the light of ſalvation unto men, and make it have place with them; for, <hi>His feet ſtanding on the Mount of Olives, makes it cleave and be a valley.</hi> 3. The acceſſe and Converſion of the Gentiles unto the Church, is a work of glorious power and grace, in effectuating which, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were cleft, partition walls broken down, &amp;c. and here it is propheſied of as an altering in part of the courſe of nature, and turning hills in valleys. 4. It takes away all ground of excuſe from the children of men, that Chriſt hath purchaſed a clear right to all Nations indifferently, to whom the offer is made to come to him, and hath laid out a plain, clear, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable way wherein to come; for, now the city hedged in with mountaines, is made patent to all, and mountaines in the way are turned in great <hi>valleys.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>It is further foretold in anſwer to the queſtion, that the way to the Church, and of worſhip and ſalvation being made clear without ceremonies, and patent to all, as a valley made of the divided mountain, the Elect among the Jewes who ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape theſe calamities ſhould ſeek unto the ſame with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Unto which prediction is added, that <hi>this valley ſhall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169977:117"/>reach unto Azal,</hi> a word which ſignifies any thing that is <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> or, <hi>ſet apart,</hi> either by election, and ſo it points at the Church figured by Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which is choſen of God, or by ſequeſtration, and putting far off, and ſo it points at the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who before were ſeparated from the Church, as by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-wall, unto whom this valley or way of ſalvation ſhall reach, excepting ſuch as are yet on <hi>Azal,</hi> that is, ſequeſtrate by Gods decree of reprobation: and thus taking both together, it agrees to what is ſaid of the Elect Jewes, they ſhall joyne with the Gentiles, for then the partition-wall ſhall be taken down, and no difference ſhall be betwixt Jew and Gentile, they being cut off from the exerciſe of ceremonies and uſe of the Temple, and however they will be ſcattered far off from the Holy Land, yet that valley ſhall reach them, and at that diſtance they ſhall ſee <hi>Zion,</hi> and may worſhip God with the Gentiles that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off. It is further added, that they ſhall <hi>flee as before an earthquake,</hi> that was memorable among the Jewes; (of which we hear no more, but that it is pointed at <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1. It may be it was when <hi>Uzziah</hi> preſumed to offer incenſe,) whereby may be pointed out their fleeing out of the land, becauſe of the judgements on them to deſtroy the Temple, and make way for their joyning in the Chriſtian Religion with the Gentiles; but it rather holds out their fleeing from the wrath to come, being moved by the power of the Goſpel, whereby this mountaine was divided, and ſo overturned all as an earthquake, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Goſpel-way of ſalvation, and the way of Gods worſhip is purchaſed by Chriſt, and revealed to the Church, not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation only, but for practice and uſe-making; for, <hi>Ye ſhall flee to the valley.</hi> 2 Under the Goſpel, the Jewes have no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial priviledge of a peculiar way of worſhip and ſalvation, but are to joyne with the Gentiles, to walk in that new and living way; for, <hi>Ye ſhall flee to the valley that reacheth to Azal,</hi> or them that were ſeparated. 3 No diſtinction of perſons, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place doth ſeclude any from the offer of the Goſpel, nor from communion with Chriſt in his Church, if they embrace it; for, <hi>the valley ſhall reach to Azal,</hi> or theſe who are ſeparated at a great diſtance, and it ſhall reach back again to <hi>Azal,</hi> or, the choſen mountain, they ſhall ſee <hi>Zion</hi> in that valley at great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance, to direct their ſervice to God dwelling there, according as they did toward the Temple. 4. Albeit the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Nations be removed under the Goſpel, yet grace is not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:169977:117"/>univerſal then; inſomuch as the meanes of grace are not offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all, at leaſt in one age; for, ſo alſo is there ſtill an <hi>Azal,</hi> or ſome ſeparate place where this valley ends. See, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 47.11.5. The power of the Goſpel, ſetting forth Chriſt, overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens excellencies and prerogatives, diſcovering ſin and wrath for ſin, will let men ſee as much cauſe to flee to Chriſt, and to embrace the way of ſalvation, as for men to avoid the moſt terrible accidents in the world; for, when by the Goſpel the mountaine ſhall cleave, and the valley be made, and Jew and Gentile ranked as equal, notwithſtanding all the Jewes Prerogatives; then, <hi>Ye ſhall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake, in the dayes of Uzziah King of Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto theſe predictions the Prophet ſubjoynes a Concluſion, <hi>and the Lord my God ſhall come, &amp;c.</hi> which may be diverſly, conſidered, and explained with relation to the former predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As, 1. By way of confirmation, that theſe things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of her enemies, and the propagation of the Goſpel ſhould come to paſſe, becauſe God had undertaken to come and fulfil them, having Angels or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fitted inſtruments, (ſanctified or ſet apart by him,) to effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuate his purpoſes; and ſo it teacheth, 1. It beſeems the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to ſet to their ſeal, and believe that what he hath undertaken will be effectual, he having inſtruments and means at his command, and it is a part of the homage they owe to him, not only not to misbelieve, but not to reſt on a general aſſent, but to rouze up themſelves to cloſe ſtedfaſtly with the Word, and reſt on it as a thing certain: for, thus doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet conclude, believing, <hi>the Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints.</hi> 2. However a believer may finde little comfort of the Word, looking to probability, or to a miſ-believing miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding world, yet it will prove a rich treaſure when he keeps communion with God, and hath converſe with him, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to hold up every word (eſpecially promiſes) by way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgement to him: ſo doth the Prophet turn his ſpeech to God, ſhewing whence his faith got life, — <hi>and all the Saints with thee.</hi> Secondly, this Concluſion may be conceived with ſpecial relation to the laſt promiſe of enlargement of the Goſpel-Chureh, and that Chriſt was to come in the fleſh to effectuate this, and to be ſpiritually preſent in his Church, whither all his Elect ſhould be gathered, as his Attendants to wait on him,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169977:118"/>which doth ſo affect the Prophet, that he ſpeaks it over in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident acknowledgement, as one affected in believing it. And ſo it teacheth, 1. The Lord beſtowes upon his people, not only things preſent that are refreſhful but alſo the hope of future mercies unto the Church, which will comfort in preſent ſad times; for, the Prophet here is refreſhed with what was to come. 2. Of all the ſweet thoughts and ſights within time, the eſtate of the Goſpel-Church is the firſt, eſpecially where there is much Converſion, and Chriſt and his traine coming to the Church, for, this raviſheth the Prophets heart: <hi>The Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints.</hi> 3. As Saints coming in to the Church is an evidence that Chriſt is there, who drawes, and as the Churches husband begets them; ſo it is an evidence of yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtations of him, wherewith to entertain theſe his friends; for, when <hi>the Saints</hi> come, <hi>be comes</hi> alſo, and they with him: every Convert helps to bring yet more of Chriſts preſence to the whole. 4. Chriſt and choiceſt Goſpel-mercies cannot reliſh to any, but ſuch as have an intereſt themſelves in them: and ſuch as are affected with the happineſſe of the Church, and mercies ſhewed to her, may take that as a mark that they have an intereſt, and that they may call Chriſt their God; ſo doth the Prophets ſtile teach us, it would not have ſo warmed his heart, nor could he have diſcerned this glory, if he had not had warrant to ſay, <hi>The Lord my God ſhall come.</hi> 5. Chriſts excellency being ſtudied, eſpecially by them who have intereſt in him, and his kinde manifeſtations to his people, cannot but raviſh hearts, and draw them to delight in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him; for, the Prophet beginning to ſpeak of him, muſt cloſe with ſpeaking to him; <hi>All the Saints with thee.</hi> Thirdly, we may yet conceive the words as looking further to the ſecond coming of Chriſt, thoughts whereof being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Prophet, (as being the cloſe and conſummation of theſe Goſpel-diſpenſations, haſtening upon the back of them, and in ſome meaſure ſhadowed out by them,) doth yet more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him in thinking upon the dayes of the Goſpel: this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is but a further enlargement of the former, and may well conſiſt with it: And teacheth us further, 1. As the dayes of the Goſpel are the latter dayes, bordering upon eternity; ſo whatever the godly finde of Goſpel-mercy within time, yet their full comfort is laid up for them in eternity; yea, the more they finde here, the more will they minde that, and what is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:169977:118"/>wanting here, is richly made up there: therefore the Prophet ſteps from the one to the conſideration of the other, to make the refreſhment full. 2. It is a refreſhful thing for one who hath intereſt in Chriſt, to think now on his ſecond coming, and it ſhall be ſo afterward to ſee it, when the excellencie of Chriſt their Head ſhall be fully revealed, in his appearing as <hi>Jebovah,</hi> in his own and his Fathers glory, when he ſhall come attended with all his glorious Angels, and all his Saints, in whom he will be admired and glorified, when he ſhall teſtifie his love and rerpect in coming again the ſecond time to fetch up his Bride, and when the poor believer ſhall fully finde the fruit of intereſt in him, and his being his God, and ſhall for ever enjoy the company of Chriſt and his followers, where none but Angels and Saints are; all this is imported in this raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mederation, <hi>The Lord my God ſhall come, and all the Saints with thee.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord by his Prophet having cleared theſe difficulties, concerning the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and foretold the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Church under the Goſpel, doth now more fully clear up the condition of the dayes of the Goſpel. So the third part of the Prophecie is a prediction of the condition of the Elect and Church of the Goſpel, during the whole tract of time, under the notion of <hi>one day,</hi> or tract of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it ſhould be unſetled and mixed, as a dark day, till toward the evening of that day, or the cloſe of time, at which time it ſhould be light. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the condition and ſtate of the Goſpel-Church, is to continue till the end of time; ſo are we to look on the time thereof as ſhort, and haſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eternity: In both theſe reſpects, it is ealled <hi>one day,</hi> or tract of Providence, though having divers periods of morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, in regard there is no change of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:169977:119"/>of the Covenant, or way of worſhipping God, to be any more expected under it, as was before, when the Ceremonial Law was aboliſhed: and in regard of the ſhortneſſe of the time, not only in reſpect of the life of particular perſons, but of the whole time till the ſecond coming of Chriſt, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the time expired before, and therefore the very dawning of this day is called <hi>the laſt dayes,</hi> and <hi>end of the world.</hi> See, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. 2. Though the condition of the dayes of the Goſpel be far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the dayes of the Law, yet the Church and godly are not to expect ſetled happineſſe, but to have an unſetled, uncertain, mixt condition of light and darkneſſe, truth and errour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and afflictions, and diſcouragements, clouds and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenks, ſtriving together and ſucceeding after other; for, ſo is imported in that <hi>the light ſhall-not be</hi> throughly <hi>clear,</hi> (or, <hi>precious) nor dark,</hi> or <hi>throughly mixed,</hi> where by <hi>preciouſneſs</hi> we are not to underſtand <hi>ſcarcity,</hi> (things precious being rare,) as if the light ſhould neither be ſcarce nor thick, but a bright light conſtantly: for, not only doth <hi>preciouſneſſe,</hi> ſpoken of light, ſignifie the brightneſſe of it, as <hi>Job</hi> 31.26. in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, but the ſeventh verſe clears this to be the meaning, where in the Original, it is not, <hi>it ſhall not be day and night,</hi> that is, a viciſſitude of day and night, but ſtill day, but thus; <hi>not day, and not night;</hi> that is, neither a clear day, nor yet dark night. This condition of the Church may be more ſenſible and viſible toward the end, and before the evening of this day, as is foretold, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. but yet it hath had its own verity in all the periods of it, ſince the firſt dawning of this day. 3. It may be an encouragement to the Church and godly, in their uncertain and unſetled condition, that they are but mixed, that heavie afflictions and diſcouragements want not comforts to make them tolerable, that no errours get truth baniſhed, and that light is not wanting, wherein men may work and walk; for; as <hi>the light is not clear,</hi> ſo it is not <hi>thickly dark,</hi> as it is <hi>not day</hi> in regard of ſome darkneſſe, ſo it is <hi>not night,</hi> in regard of ſome light and confolo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions, which ſhould not be ſmall with us. And in this reſpect the dayes of the Goſpel, how mixed ſoever, are ſtill <hi>a day,</hi> as differing from a Sun-ſet, and dark night of total ignorance, ceremonies, diſcouragement, &amp;c. 4. As the determining of times continuance after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Goſpel, is by the Father kept in his own hand,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:169977:119"/>ſo it may be an encouragement, to endure the various conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe times, that they will be but ſhort, be what they will; for, <hi>It is one day known to the Lord,</hi> that is, known to him, how long it ſhall continue, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36. yet this is known to all, that it ſhall be (at leaſt to every one in particular) but ſhort as one day. 5. It is a further encouragement to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Church, that all her lots are of Gods carving out, and that he hath an eſpecial eye and providence upon her dark times for her good; for, thus alſo is the <hi>day known to the Lord,</hi> carved out and cared for, and ſeen to by him. 6. It may yet further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, that the Churches ſaddeſt times ſhall end in light and comfort; <hi>It ſhall he light:</hi> that this light ſhall come, when looking to all probability, we might expect more darkneſſe, as at evening time, when the Sun hers, and light removes; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially this may encourage, that toward the end of the dayes of the Goſpel, eſpecially when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the fulneſſe of the Gentiles ſhall be converted, there will be a time of light, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and eaſe; for, <hi>at the evening-time</hi> of this day, <hi>it ſhall be light,</hi> which is not to be underſtood abſolutely, that there ſhould be no mixture then, but comparatively, in reſpect of former times; for, tribulations ſhall be immediately before his ſecond coming, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The fourth part of this Prophecie, containes a prediction of the ſpiritual graces of the Goſpel, whereby the darkneſſe of the times are counterbalanced; and made to ſhine with ſome light. In ſumme thus, the doctrine of ſalvation, containing all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel refreſhments, and holding forth, and inſtrumentally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating all gifts and graces acted and applied by the Spirit, (for ſo are <hi>living waters</hi> to be underſtood, <hi>John</hi> 4 14. and 7.38, 39.) ſhall by the Apoſtles be derived from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ere it be deſtroyed, to all parts of the world, figured out by the bounds of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> from the lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> on the Eaſt, (or further to the Perſick ſea, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 47.8.) and the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean ſea on the Weſt, and ſhall be as a Spring-well, which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169977:120"/>ſhall continue both Summer and Winter.

The pouring out of the Spirit, and the refreſhments of the Goſpel, are the chief meanes of healing the Churches diſtempers, and ſweetening her ſad times; for, this makes light in her darkneſſe and evening, that <hi>living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> go out. 2. The Spirit of Chriſt and Goſpel-riches are ſufficient to ſatisfie and quench the ſouls thirſt, to take away exceſſive longing after other things, to refreſh the wearie, purge the unclean, and make the barren fruitful; for, in theſe reſpects are the treaſures conveyed in and by the doctrine of the Goſpel, compared to <hi>waters.</hi> 3. It is the character of theſe who enjoy the Spirit of Chriſt, and feed indeed upon the treaſures of the Goſpel, that they are lively and freſh, not mouldie, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and formal, nor as emptie clouds without raine: for, <hi>theſe waters</hi> are <hi>living waters,</hi> not only themſelves ſpringing and conſtant, but in theſe who drink them, lively in their effects. 4. It ſpeaks much of the freedome and riches of grace offered in the Goſpel, that they are not confined to any one Nation or People, but ſent abroad unto all (or many) Nations, and that they are ſufficient to refreſh and ſatisfie all, as a river that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a whole Kingdome, or whole city, every one receiving, as if there were no more to receive; for, <hi>They ſhall go forth from Jeruſalem to the former and the hinder ſea.</hi> 5. The doctrine of the Goſpel is permanent, and to endure for ever, ſo as neither heat of perſecution, nor decay of zeal in the Church, ſhall be able to overthrow it, or hinder it from ſpreading where Chriſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and from triumphing over errout. It is alſo permanent in its effects in believers, in whom grace once received ſhall never be totally extinct, and it ſhall be to them enough for all conditions, to refreſh them in the heat of perſecution, and quicken them in their dead and frozen condition. <hi>In Summer and in Winter it ſhall be,</hi> as a Spring, that is, neither exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Summer-heat, nor made inacceſſible, or dried up with Winter-froſt.</p>

                  <p>Unto this petition a threatening is ſubjoyned againſt theſe who will not ſubmit themſelves and joyne with the Church, to wit, that they ſhould want raine, whereby is ſignified literally, barrenneſſe of their land and famine, or more generally, the want of a refreſhful bleſſing, or of a teſtimony of favour upon them and what they have, they wanting heavenly grace and influence. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will be multiplied on theſe, who having ſeen the hand of the Lord upon enemies, and having been convinced by the ſtooping of others, do yet ſtand out and rebel; for, after the plague of the Nations, and others going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this plague comes on others. Clear convincing light, being diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, ripens for ſad ſtroaks. 3. Where the Goſpel, and Chriſt offered in it is not received, as it is a judgement ſufficient to be deprived of the refreſhful grace of God, and be left under ſcorching wrath: ſo God can eaſily adde to this, famine of their bodies who ſuffer their ſoules to ſtarve, and the withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his bleſſing from temporal eſtates; for, <hi>Even upon them ſhall be no raine.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>This threatening is particularly applied to <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Churches old enemie, who by reaſſon of the overflowing of <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſeemed not to need raine, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.10. and though they had ſome at ſometimes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.32. yet they might
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169977:124"/>ſubſiſt better without it then others, they are threatened with the ſame plague with others, and to be as much ſtraitened as if they needed raine. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As ſuch as have been greateſt enemies, may yet be gained to the Goſpel, ſo ſuch perſevering in their rebellion will be eſpecially eyed and ſtricken: therefore he names <hi>Egypt</hi> the Jewes ancient enemie, ſuppoſing that ſome of them will ſubmit, as is promiſed, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rebels that he will then pay them home, once for all. 2. The way of the wickeds temporal mercies ſeem to put them out of Gods reverence, or at leaſt they reckon ſo, whereas the excellencie of any mercie the godly receives, conſiſts in this, that it puts them yet to more dependance on God, and to need further manifeſtations of him; for, <hi>Egypt</hi> is a land that ſeems not to need rain, whereas <hi>Canaan</hi> depended on the dew of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.10, 11, 12. 3.

Nothing is ſo prophane, but it may be ſanctified and made holy, when Chriſt begins to reigne through the world, and it is ſo unto the pure; for then holineſſe ſhall not be confined to Prieſts and Temple-ſervices, but <hi>bells of horſes</hi> going to war, and theſe employments that ſeem moſt impure ſhall bear <hi>holineſſe unto the Lord.</hi> 3.

                  <p>Secondly, it is promiſed, that <hi>the pots in the Temple ſhould be like the bowles before the Altar,</hi> not ſo much for number in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of many ſacrifices, <hi>v.</hi> 21. as for purity: there being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of holineſſe in the ſeveral places and inſtruments belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto in the Temple, theſe ſhould be elevated to an higher p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo it teacheth, 1. That the doctrine and diſcipline of the Church is then agreeable to the Scripture, when by doctrine it is declared that none are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or approved as members of the inviſible Church in the Court of Conſcience, but the elect and faithful, and the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God only: and when by diſcipline none are admitted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued members in the outward Court, but ſuch as ſubmit to the doctrine and diſcipline of the Church, and give up their names unto Chriſt; for, when this rule is followed, <hi>there is no Canaanite admitted in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> And who ſo followeth not this rule, but will follow the rules of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, in their external Eccleſiaſtical adminiſtrations, or will in the point of doctrine allow people to acquieſce in that as ſufficient before God unto ſalvation, which is ſufficient to the viſible Church to go upon in the outward Court, theſe cannot but condemn the innocent, and abſolve ſinners. 2. The Lord may and doth at ſome times let out much of his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169977:126"/>on his Church, to make real holineſſe and purity abound in it and ſhame out what is contrary to it, or ſhort of it, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to the rules ordinarily preſcribed for conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Churches; for, taking this Prophecie at its fulleſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it only foretels, that in ſome age of the Goſpel-Church, and particularly about the Converſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> real holineſſe and Converſion ſhall be very frequent, ſo that all who come to the Church, ſhall be aſhamed not to look ſomewhat like them, yet ſuppoſing they were all to be real Saints, (which never will be within time,) it doth not follow, that it is the duty of the Church in all ages to admit none but ſuch in the outward Court, for his diſpenſations are not the Churches rule, more then it will follow, that becauſe the Lord makes in every age ſome real Saints more eminent then others, therefore the Church ſhould reject all who come not to that pitch. But if we look on theſe words more narrowly, we may finde them looking another way: for the promiſe is not of their being caſt out of the land, but of their not being in the Temple, where Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites weee not admitted as ſuch to enter or abide: ſometime indeed pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore I conceive that the place points at the practice of the Jewes in their Temple, who had Gibeonites, (who were Canaanites, and were afterward from their office called Nethinims, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.58. 1 <hi>Chro</hi> 9.2) given for the ſervice of the Prieſts and Congregation, in bringing wood and water to the Altar and ſacrifices, <hi>Joſh</hi> 9.21, 27. and foretels that there ſhall be none ſuch then in the Temple, to ſignifie and teach, not ſo much that there ſhould be no ſacrifices then need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch ſervice; as 1. That under the Goſpel there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Nations, <hi>no Canaanite in the Temple,</hi> to ſerve in inferiour offices, and Iſraelite or Levite to the Miniſter to the Lord, for, then Prieſts and Levites are of remoteſt Nations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.20, 21. 2.

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:169977:128"/>Church: and particularly the Elect among you have taſted of my ſpecial love. 2. Gods love to his Church is oft-times met with great ingratitude, in not being ſeen and acknowledged as becomes, eſpecially under croſſe diſpenlations, in undervaluing the effects of it, when they fit not our mould, and in deeds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, while thoughts of it do not beget love to him again; for, <hi>Yet ye ſay, Wherein haſt thou loved us?</hi> 3. Election unto eternal life is a ſufficient teſtimony of Gods love, to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and commended, although all things elſe went croſſe, and ſeemed to ſpeak diſ-reſpect; for, in this, <hi>the Lord loved Jacob, and hated Eſau,</hi> as is exponed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. and this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to anſwer their quarrelling. 4 To be choſen and ſelected to be the Lords Church and peculiar people, ſpeaks ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from God unto a Nation, as may counterbalance many other hard lots; for, thus alſo <hi>was Ja<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lords love will not be ſo clearly ſeen and acknowledged, when we compare ſome diſpenſations with the priviledges beſtowed upon us, but when we conſider our own original, and wherein we are dealt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with beyond others, as good as our ſelves, if not better; for, however <hi>Iſrael,</hi> looking on their many priviledges, could not ſee Gods love in their low condition, yet it would better appear when they looked back, that <hi>Eſau was Jacobs brother,</hi> (and the elder too) and yet <hi>I loved Jacob and I hated Eſau.</hi> 6. The grace of God is not diſpenſed differently in the world, upon any difference in the point of worth among men; but grace it ſelf makes the difference in chooſing out one, and leaving an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as good in himſelf to his own wayes, according to his pleaſure, who hath mercie on whom he will have mercy; for, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are equal, till love make the difference. 7. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever no man can know love or hatred by outward diſpenſations, ſimply conſidered in themſelves, yet afflictions are to wicked men, real teſtimonies of Gods diſpleaſure, and Gods people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at peace with him, may look on external mercies, as ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpecial love; for <hi>Eſaus</hi> hillie land, and the deſolation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſpeaks <hi>hating of Eſau,</hi> not only as rejection from <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a type of rejection from the Church and heaven, but as it was a judgement inflicted on a Nation unreconciled, whereas (at leaſt) the godly in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might look otherwiſe on their land and reſtitution.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond fault, for which the Prieſts eſpecially are at large reproved, is the contempt of Gods Name, which the Lord may juſtly complaine of, conſidering both, that he was herein ſleighted more then any creature calling for ſuch reſpect was by another; a maſter or father would get more reſpect then he who was both in an eminent way, to that people; and (which is yet more) that they did not conſider this, nor were convinced of it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

As the Lord hath an abſolute dominion over all his creatures, and eſpecially over his Church, whom he hath made and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to be his in a peculiar way: ſo it hath pleaſed him to ſweeten this with a more warme relation of fatherly affection and care, to his people; He is both <hi>a Maſter,</hi> and <hi>a Father.</hi> 4. The Lord allows and requires that ſervice performed to him be ſeaſoned both with fear and love, that love and a deſire to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him as a Father, be the principle of our obedience, and yet that we look on our ſelves as ſervants in reſpect of ſtrict obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to duty, and ſear to offend; for, as <hi>a father,</hi> he muſt have <hi>honour,</hi> and as a <hi>maſter, fear.</hi> 5. As it is the grand deluſion that blindes the viſible Church, that it is ſufficient to give good words, and faire titles to God, though no care be had of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able walking; So the Lord will make uſe of that which every one acknowledges, to be a witneſſe againſt themſelves, if their carriage be not anſwerable; for, <hi>If I be a Father,</hi> (as ye call me) <hi>where is my honour? If I be a Maſter, where is my fear? ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> 6. As men in performing duties to God, come farre ſhort of that which very nature will teach them is due to creatures, ſtanding in the ſame relation (though in an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or degree) that God is; ſo the very reſpect, which is paid as due to ſuch, will be a ditty againſt ſleighters of God: for, <hi>A ſonnes honouring his father, and a ſervant his maſter,</hi> reproves them, who neither honour nor fear God, being both. 7. Carnal
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:169977:130"/>contempt, and want of reverence unto, and an high eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, in every duty, is a fountaine-cauſe of all miſcarriage, and an evidence that we behave our ſelves neither as ſonnes nor ſervants; for, he proves want of <hi>honour and fear,</hi> becauſe <hi>ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe my Name.</hi> 8. However to ſleight and diſeſteem of God be a general ſinne in the viſible Church, yet ordinarily teachers of others are chiefly guilty, not only in their own walking and ſervice, but alſo in their acceſſion to the guilt of others, while their way makes others to abhorre or contemne God and his ſervice, or hardens them in ſo doing, and while they neither informe or reprove people in their ſleighting of God, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds them in it, as if it were good ſervice; therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all the people were guilty of theſe faults, yet more eſpecially <hi>ye Prieſts deſpiſe my Name.</hi> 9. A people living under ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and injoying priviledges, and not profiting, will ſoon come to this, not to ſee their ſinne well, not to conſider on it, and be hard to be convinced of it; for, when God challengeth, they replie, <hi>and ye ſay, Wherein have we deſpiſed thy Name?</hi> and ſo frequently through this book.</p>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169977:130"/>is commanded, ſleightly, bringing common diſpoſitions to his immediate ſervice; or, in ordinary converſation not to walk as becomes worſhippers; for, this is ſignified by this challenge, <hi>ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar;</hi> their ſacrifices were pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, either when they were not ſuch as the law required, or when the worſhippers had not Temple purifications, or when having committed abominions, they came and truſted to their purifications and offerings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11,—15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.9, 10. 2. God conſtructs of mens prophaning of his worſhip any way as done againſt himſelfe, and flowing from much contempt of him, who if he were reverenced, his ſervice would be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly attended; for, <hi>their offering of polluted bread,</hi> proves that challenge that <hi>they deſpiſe his Name, v.</hi> 6. and is <hi>a polluting of him:</hi> our reſpect to him will appear chiefly in our immediate approaching to him. 3. As it is a ſpecial, and not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favour, for ſinners to be bettered by admonition, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; ſo the more they are reproved and not bettered, it hardens the more and addes to the ſinne; for, this replie, <hi>wherein have we polluted thee?</hi> imports not only that they had been reproved before by the Prophets, but that they were ſo farre from being bettered, that they went on in the ſinne without a challenge, and were ſo hardened, that they would not be convinced. 4. It is a great aggravation of ſinne, when men not only go wrong and ſee it not, but ſee alſo reaſon why they ſhould do as they do, and their principles lead them to ſinne; for, it was an high polluting of God, when not only <hi>the bread was polluted:</hi> but they ſeemed to have reaſon for what they did, and ſaid, <hi>That the table of the Lord is contemptible,</hi> and therefore, they might offer any thing. 5.

It is the wofull preſumption and neck-break of many, that when they walk as they pleaſe, they yet think to continue in the reputation of being ſeekers of God, and by prayer (while yet they continue in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented ſinne) to turne away any ſtroke; for, this holy irony, and putting them to it, <hi>I pray you, beſeech God,</hi> imports, that they thought to aſſey that, and to make all well. 2. It is high time for a people to pray, when guilt is contracted and wrath is threatened; mercy alſo muſt be the praying mans refuge, and all ought to be ſenſible of their having an hand in publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations; for, however this exhortation be directed to them,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169977:132"/>as that which they could neither well obey, nor would their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be accepted, yet it containes in it ſelfe a pattern of duty, that in ſuch a time men ſhould <hi>beſeech God,</hi> plead for <hi>graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us,</hi> where the Prophet ranks himſelfe among the reſt of the people needing this grace. 3. It is a ſore judgement to lie in ſuch a condition as provokes God to reject prayer, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how we are indigent of all good, and expoſed to all danger, and that prayer is the only meanes to obtaine the one or remove the other; and eſpecially it is a judgement to be ſo, and not know it till we be put to the extremity; for, <hi>I pray you, beſeech God, will he regard your perſons?</hi> imports that God would ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently puniſh them in not hearing them, and that they were ſo ſtupid as not to know it, till they eſſayed it. 4. All who would finde acceptance and audience in prayer, ought to ſtudy perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reconciliation with God; and theſe who are imployed by Office or otherwiſe to intercede for others, ought to be holy themſelves, that their perſonal wickedneſſe wrong not themſelves and others; for, <hi>will he regard your perſons?</hi> imports that their perſons were not reconciled, and ſo they could not be heard, and that they were moſt unfit to intercede for others. 5. As ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily unfaithfull Miniſters are chief in the guilt of the people: ſo ſuch as are chief authors in an evil way, cannot but finde their prayers for themſelves or others rejected; for, <hi>This hath been by your meanes,</hi> (or, <hi>from your hand) will he regard your perſons? ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> 6. Whatever may be the preſumption of ſecure and impenitent ſinners, yet God will make their own conſcience, when he awakens it in ſtraite, to pronounce their ſentence; for, he appeales to themſelves, <hi>will he regard your perſons?</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond branch of the ſentence is, the rejection of their perſons and of all their ſacrifices, and ſervices performed in the Temple, which is amplified from a queſtion in the beginning of the verſe; the meaning whereof, as it is tranſlated, is, as if
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169977:132"/>he ſaid, All of you Porters, Prieſts, and others, have been well rewarded by tythes and other caſualties, for your meaneſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and yet ye have proven evil ſervants, ye have been more greedy of gaine then duty, ye have been carefull for your ſelves, and would do nothing for me or any of the people for nought, and yet ye have been negligent, and did not your duty faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, nor watched over the ſacrifices to trie them exactly; and therefore I reject you and your ſervice both. The words in the Original will alſo bear this reading, <hi>Who among you would ſhut the doores, and not kindle a fire on my altar in vaine? &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſaid, Is there none among you that hath ſo much zeal as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhut the doores of the Temple, and ſo hinder theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which are in vaine, for I approve not of you, nor will receive them? Both theſe come to one purpoſe, that God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and would reject the ſervice of theſe ingrate ſervants, it being (in ſome ſort) better they offered none at all. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a ſad judgement when a people are put altogether out of ſervice, that God will have no more from them, or not accept them in it: as importing that God is angry at them, that he will put ſuch away altogether from him at laſt, and will deprive them of the free reward which is beſtowed on his ſervants; for, this is their doom, <hi>I will not accept an offering at your hand.</hi> Whereas a people getting leave to offer ſervice, and God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at their hand, ſpeaks mercy in ſaddeſt times, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.23. 2. The worth and excellency of our ſervice depends upon Gods free favour, and his acceptation in Chriſt of our perſons and worſhip, which when we provoke him to take away or withhold, no worth in us or it will avail, whatever we may conceit or dream; for, where <hi>he hath no pleaſure he will not accept an offering.</hi> 3. The meaneſt ſervice performed to God, wants not a reward, yea, even the ſuperficial ſervice he gets, hath its outward reward, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his patience; for, Prieſts and Porters did not <hi>ſhut the doors,</hi> or, <hi>kindle the fire for nought, they were well paid.</hi> 4. It is the Lords allowance, that theſe whom he ſets apart for his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice in his Church, do live and be maintained thereby; for, Prieſts and Porters had their allowance. 5. It is the ſin, and a token of unfaithfulneſſe in Miniſters, when they become covetous, and eye the reward more then the work; for, this challenge imports alſo their covetouſneſſe, and that as they had allowance, ſo they minded it much, and were ſure to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without that, and having gotten that, they regarded not
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169977:133"/>much Gods part. 6. The more kinde God hath been to any in ſerving him, if yet they prove unfaithful, the greater will their ſin be; for, thus is their ſin aggravated, they did nothing <hi>for nought,</hi> and yet did it not well. 7. However it be ſtill a ſin to neglect altogether commanded duties, yet in ſome reſpect ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſervice, and reſting upon external performances, is more hainous then if men altogether let it alone, as being an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of contempt of God, and that to his face; for, ſo much doth the other reading of the words import. See, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12, 12. and 66.3.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The third branch of the ſentence is, that he will transfer the Prieſthood from their order, and his worſhip from that people, and get among the Gentiles (whom they deſpiſe) peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Miniſters, who will worſhip him more purely through the world then they do, when he ſhall magnifie his grace, and manifeſt his majeſty among them; this is ſubjoyned as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the former ſentence, <hi>v.</hi> 10. he will reject them, for he will get better ſervice elſewhere. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord is no loſer by any who ſleight him: all the advantage or loſſe of mens ſervice is their own; and though God reject a viſible Church for ſin, yet he will not want enough to ſerve him; for, ſo doth he threaten the Jewes and Prieſts, that he would fill up their room with Gentiles. 2. The glory of God, and of his Kingdome in his Church, doth ſhine more conſpicuouſly under the Goſpel then under the Law; for, then his ſervice was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to one Nation, now enlarged to all Nations of <hi>the Gentiles;</hi> then his worſhip was ſhut up in <hi>Judea,</hi> and their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip was only in one place, <hi>Now from the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame, and in every place,</hi> he may be worſhipped; then their ſervice, however pure in reſpect of inſtitution, yet was carnal and full of ſhadowes, and was at
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169977:133"/>this time prophaned by them: But the Goſpel-ſervice is not only pure in reſpect of inſtitution, but more perſpicuous and ſpiritual; and however many do yet pollute it, yet many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it more purely then they did, and there are far more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and pure worſhippers in the Church of the Goſpel, then was in the Church of the Jewes: <hi>It ſhall be incenſe and a pure offering,</hi> ſpeaking of Goſpel worſhip in the language of theſe times. 3. As God is great in himſelf, ſo an high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of him, (which only himſelf, who doth reveal himſelf, can work in hearts,) in his majeſty and graciouſneſſe, is a means to produce reverend and pure worſhip; for, <hi>My Name ſhall be great among the Gentiles,</hi> ſaith he, twice over, as undertaking it, <hi>when incenſe and a pure offering is offered.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The equity of this ſentence, of rejecting them and chooſing others, is confirmed from their (eſpecially the Prieſts) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning of Gods Name, which the heathen would magnifie when it ſhould be made known unto them. This he proves by their deeds and expreſſions accounting of the Altar and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as polluted in reſpect of what it was, and all the oblations or any thing they had for their ſhare as contemptible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing might ſuffice to be offered. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and juſtice of Gods ſentence againſt ſinners, eſpecially in the viſible Church, is not ſoon ſeen or laid to heart by them, nor the cauſes procuring it, conſidered; therefore is it ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſſe it, as here. 2. Neceſſary truths and inſtructions are oft-times ſo ill heard, that they muſt be again and again preſſed, therefore is that ſame doctrine repeated here from <hi>v.</hi> 7. 3 Contempt of God and his ſervice is no where more rife, then where there is moſt frequent occaſion of ſervice, and it is ſuperficially performed; for, the Prieſts being ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and ſtill about ſervice, they <hi>prophane his Name, and ſay, The Table of the Lord is polluted, &amp;c.</hi> 4 Hypocritical and formal worſhip is a prophanation, and taking the Name of God in vaine, and in its own kinde an hainons breach of the command, for which God will not hold men guiltleſſe; for,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:169977:134"/>
                     <hi>Ye have prophaned my Name, in that ye ſay, The Table of the Lord it polluted, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>A further evidence of their prophaning his Name, (which yet confirmes the ſentence) is, that they ſerved God with wearineſſe, and ſnuffed at the frequencie of ſacrifices, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ceremonial obſervations. Whence it came to paſſe, that they made no conſcience of ſacrifices, but the people brought, and they accepted what came to hand, or could do no good otherwiſe, which their own conſcience might tell them could not be accepted. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Wearying and repining at Gods ſervice, as it is the ordinary ſin of all within the viſible Church who are earnal, and ſee not the Majeſtie of God, nor feel ſweetneſſe in worſhip; and eſpecially is the ftuit of contempt of him: So it is enough to make ſervice abominable before God, ſeeing he loves and requires a willing people; <hi>Ye ſaid alſo, What a wearineſſe is it? and ye ſnuffed at it.</hi> 2. They who wearie in Gods ſervice, if they do not quite abandon it, will ſoon ſleight it, and minde nothing more when they come about it, then how to get it over any way; for, <hi>Ye brought that which was torne, and the lame, and the ſick for an offering.</hi> 3.

Doct.</hi> 1. As to be under a curſe from God is the ſaddeſt of judgements, though no preſent outward affliction ſhould follow thereupon; ſo it is the portion of obſtinate ſleighters of Gods worſhip: <hi>Curſed be the deceiver, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The Lord abhors the wrongs that are done under faireſt pretences of zeal and piety, more then theſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their own colours, as being twice an injurie; for, <hi>The deceiver is curſed,</hi> who doth all under colour of zeale and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, making vowes which are a teſtimony of ſingular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and performing them, which ſeems to ſpeak integrity, <hi>He vowes and ſacrifices,</hi> and yet it is but <hi>a corrupt thing,</hi> when he hath better. 3. Albeit the Lord can get nothing of it ſelf perfect from his people, yet it is their duty not to give him the refuſe of what they have, as if all were loſt that is employed in this ſervice, but to ſpend and employ the beſt of their ſtrength, time, parts and affections in his ſervice; and albeit our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation go far beyond our ability, yet it cannot but procure a curſe, when willingly we lie by, and emprove not all received ability; for, <hi>He is curſed, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi> 4. As double and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial dealing in Gods ſervice, floweth from mean thoughts of him; ſo his greatneſs is ſuch, as wil not ſit with affronts, eſpecially under pretence of doing him honour; for, this is one reaſon of the curſe; <hi>For I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> 5. The eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that very Pagans are forced to have of a Deity, by reaſon of common Providences, and of the true God from what they ſee of him at any time in doing for his people, and againſt their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,

And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially Miniſters being ſenſible of their duty, will make it their chief care, to ſee God exalted in his own ordinances, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then how to advantage or ſet out themſelves; for, this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth on the other two, <hi>to give glory unto my Name.</hi> 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the curſe of God, (which is the ſaddeſt of judgements) be due for every tranſgreſſion of his Law; yet it is for the ſin of impenitency chiefly, that the Lord lets out any viſible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences thereof, for, it is when they <hi>will not heare, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>he ſends a curſe upon them.</hi> 5. Curſes are moſt ſad curſes when they are inflicted on bleſſings, either in removing of them, or in depriving of the comfort and bleſſing of them, or in making them ſnares to the enjoyers, <hi>I will curſe your bleſſings.</hi> 6. It is alſo a ſad evidence of a curſe upon Miniſters and people, when the bleſſings allowed upon, or promiſed to the Church take not effect, and when Miniſters are left to themſelves to promiſe and pronounce good things, when in the mean time God is ſending on judgements: Thus alſo are <hi>bleſſings curſed,</hi> when they (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to their office, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.23.) flattered the people with promiſed bleſſings, and God did contrary, and ſent a curſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof. 7. It is a ſad judgement when a people are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a curſe, and are inſenſible, and not ſtirred up to repent; but need to have their caſe being ſo, and the cauſe thereof, preſſed upon them; for, they know not till God tell them; <hi>I have curſed them already, becauſe ye do not lay it to heart.</hi>

(to which here he points) occaſioning that Covenant. And in this, their Progenitors ſtudied to walk in ſome meaſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably, in teaching the Law holily and purely, and ſtudying to pleaſe God, and enjoy the promiſed peace of the Covenant, by humble and quiet obedience to the rule of righteouſneſſe. And as they endeavoured to acquit themſelves, ſo God bleſſed their labours in converting many. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It concernes them who ſtand under any particular obligation to God, to be much in ſtudying both of the encouragements allowed upon them,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:169977:138"/>that they faint not in his ſervice, and of their duty, that they delude not themſelves, expecting priviledges when they minde not their work: for this end is the Covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi> ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid before the Prieſts. 2. Faithful Miniſters have eſpecial need of a Covenaut of preſervation from God, being expoſed to much hazard many times: and of the hope of etrnal life, being often exerciſed with ſad times here; and in outward things, to have the Lord ſecuring their portion to them. And for all theſe may faithful Miniſters truſt God; for, <hi>My cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was with him of life,</hi> (that is, preſervation here, and hope of a better life hereafter) <hi>and peace</hi> or proſperity. 3. It is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial qualification of faithful Miniſters, and an evidence that they are to receive a bleſſing, when much familiarity with holy things doth not breed contempt, but their heart is filled with awe and reverence of God, and they go about his worſhip with holy reverence and trembling, and do teſtifie much tenderneſs and zeal againſt any wrong done to God; for, <hi>I gave them to him for the feare wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my Name.</hi> And thus was it with <hi>Phinehas, Numb.</hi> 25.12, 13. 4. The practice of theſe who have gone before, and by walking in the wayes of God, have inherited the promiſed bleſſing, will be a ditty againſt them who decline, and look upon their duty as intolerable, or their encouragements as hopeleſſe; for, the practice and bleſſing on former Prieſts are recorded, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the preſent unfaithful ones. 5. It is incumbent to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, that they be neither dumb nor liars, that they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves faithfully againſt errour, and be faithful pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers of truth; for, <hi>the Law of truth was in his mouth.</hi> 6. Albeit no mortal man can be ſo faithful, but that if God ſearch him, he will not be able to ſtand: yet it is not ſufficient for a Miniſter, that he do not groſſely debord in his calling, but he ought to carry himſelf ſo as he may abide a trial, for, he endeavoured holineſſe, ſingleneſſe and integrity in revealing the counſel of God; for, <hi>Iniquity was not found in his lips.</hi> 7. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit people are to look to the Word carried by Miniſters, and obey God ſpeaking it, whatever the Meſſenger be: yet it is the duty of faithful Miniſters, to take heed that their carriage do not belie their doctrine, or miniſter occaſion to bring it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but that their practice may prove their own believing of their doctrine, and that they ſhine in their private converſation, as well as in their publick ſtation; for, therefore is the <hi>walking</hi>

As it is the duty of all Chriſtians, ſo eſpecially of Miniſters, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the wayes of godlineſſe, and <hi>walk</hi> in them, to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in them, as in the ſight of God, and to be on his ſide of all the controverſies of their time, which is to <hi>walk with him,</hi> to make peace with God their great aime, and for that end to be humble in their obedience, and not rebellious to occaſion quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, which is <hi>to walk with him in peace,</hi> and to follow the rule of righteouſneſſe, and <hi>walk in equity,</hi> or <hi>rightneſſe</hi> in all their wayes. 9.

Contempt is in it ſelf a ſore ſcourge and trial, wherewith God (as by other rods) uſeth to puniſh ſin; and therefore they are not to count light of it, who inflict that rod unjuſtly; <hi>I have made you contemptible,</hi> is a ſufficient ſcourge for wicked Prieſts. 2. Albeit it was the lot of Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles, to be diſreſpected in a wicked world, and albeit ſuch a trial may be uſeful to faithful Miniſters, to purge out ambition and ſelf-conceit (the weed that growes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong greateſt excellencies, and is an enemie to ſincerity) and to make them die more to the world and ſtudie to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169977:140"/>to God; and that by this trial, God may breed them for enduring harder ſufferings (the great ſting whereof is ſhame and reproach) when he ſhall give a calling to them; yet unfaithful Miniſters are the moſt contemptible crew in all the world, in Gods eſtimation, and ignominie, and contempt, is the juſt fruit of their unfaithfulneſſe, their lot being made like their ſervice, and ſuch a lot is then a plague and judgement, when it is the fruit of ſuch carriage; for <hi>therefore have I alſo made you contemptible, and baſe before all the people, according as ye have not kept my wayes.</hi> 3. As it is a fearful ſin to pervert the Word of God, whereof men are but diſpenſers, and may well teſtifie their own preſumption, and delude others, but cannot alter one tittle of the Word in its effects, God being no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſo it is righteous with God, that Miniſters hunting after honour, applauſe and eſtimation, by partiality and pleaſing of men, do by that very meane come in contempt, whereas faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters may have a teſtimony and reſpect in the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of theſe who hate them moſt; for, <hi>I have made you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, according as ye have been partial in my Law.</hi>

                  <p>In the reſt of the chapter, other faults common to Prieſts and people are reproved. And firſt, the Lord challenges their treacherous dealing one with another, which may indeed be well applied to the partiality of the Prieſts, prophaning their Covenant as an aggravation thereof, conſidering that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difference they make amongſt men in their doctrine, for outward reſpects, yet in Gods account all theſe by-reſpects will vaniſh, and he will look on them as equal, <hi>James</hi> 2.1, 2, &amp;c. And that their partiality is treacherous and perfidious dealing to theſe whom they ſpare, however they think it to be ſavour. It may alſo be applied to that which follows, of their breach of the Covenant of marriage made amongſt themſelves, who were of one ſtock and Religion, and their marrying with idolaters. But it is more clear to underſtand it generally of unjuſt and fraudulent deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in mens affaires, which is a violation of many bonds and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169977:140"/>relations, being all <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, created and made a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people to himſelf by the ſame God, having ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in following the ſame true Religion, making them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren one to another, and being bound by a Covenant, (derived to them from, and oft renewed with their fathers,) to God and among themſelves, to the duties both of piety and juſtice, <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Prophaned and ſleighted worſhip is oft-times accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with groſſe faults againſt the ſecond Table, that in theſe men may reade their tranſgreſſion of the firſt, and their little conſidering of it; for ſo much doth its challenge, and the reſt that enſue, following upon the former, of neglected wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, teach us. 2. Injuſtice in Civil affaires, eſpecially where it is conveyed under fraudulent pretexts, is an evil which the Lord will not bear, nor will a wakened conſcience beare within it ſelf: for, <hi>Why do we deal treacherouſly, &amp;c?</hi> ſaith he, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing themſelves about it. 3. As we are bound to deal juſtly with all, ſo eſpecially it is an abomination to deal perfidiouſly with theſe to whom we are tied by many bonds of Nature and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for, <hi>Why deal we treacherouſly, every man againſt his brother, having one Father, and one God having created us?</hi> 4. Gods entering in a Covenant with a people and Church, and continuing the priviledges thereof long with them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to ſtand, when their provocations might juſtly have broken it off, is an aggravation, not only of impiety, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of worſhip, but even of injuſtice among men; for, <hi>Why deal we treacherouſly in prophaning the Covenant of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi> walking as prophanely as if they were not tied by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and as if a Covenant were a prophane, not a ſacred thing, and as if the priviledges thereof, continued from their fathers to them, were but ſmall things, and not obliging favours. 5. Such is the ſlavery that men, devoted to their luſts and idols, are brought under, that no relations or obligations will binde them up from debording; for, notwithſtanding all theſe ties, there are <hi>who deal treacherouſly.</hi> 6. If mens conſciences were acting their parts, the Lords ſervants might have leſſe toile in diſcharging their duty; men would not only ſee their ſin, but would aggrege it in its ſinfulneſſe; for, theſe many queſtions ſhewes, that tender conſciences would plead this cauſe for him.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond fault whereof both Prieſts and people were guilty, as the hiſtory of theſe times cleareth, is in the matter of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, wherein the chief guilt and fountain of all the reſt is their marriage with idolatrous women, occaſioned as appears, in that their lawful wives being out-wearied with travel, they loathed them, and fell in love with the women of the countrey. This is aggravated from the nature of the ſin, the perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, the place where they did it, and that it tended to a proſtituting, (as a prophane thing) of their peculiar dignity, to be the Lords holy, or ſeparated and ſet-apart people, and of that holineſſe which God required in them, and they profeſſed to approve. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As marriage is a comfortable Ordinance of God, ſo eſpecial care is to be had by the people of God, of being equally yoked, and to avoid the ſin and ſnare of marriage with idolaters, and theſe of a falſe Religion; for, however under the Goſpel, the partition-wall that was betwixt the Church, and all other Nations under the Old Teſtament, be pulled down; and albeit difference of Religion be no cauſe of diſſolving a marriage under the Goſpel, which is conſummate, eſpecially being made up before the Converſion of any of the parties, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12, 13. yet it is ſtill a blot and guilt for a member of the Church, <hi>to marry the daughter of a ſtrange god,</hi> ſo called becauſe of her Profeſſion. See, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39. and before the Law it was the ſin of the old world, that the ſons of God came in to the daughters of men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. 2. Such as would ſee ſin in its colours, would take it up in its aggravation, both in reſpect of God and men, and how abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable and perfidious it is ſo to do; for, ſo is this ſin aggravated, as <hi>treacherous dealing,</hi> both againſt God, and their lawful wives to whom they were tied, and as <hi>abomination</hi> in the ſight of God, making them abominable to whom this was forbidden. 3. The conſideration of the perſon ſinning, addes much to the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſin, and the place and time wherein they do ſin, when
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:169977:141"/>it is done by members of the Church, as it were in Gods view in his Church, and after God hath been kinde to them; for, if <hi>Judah</hi> and all that now remained of <hi>Iſrael</hi> do thus, who ſhall ſerve him beſide? and if they do it <hi>in Iſrael and Jeruſalem,</hi> where God dwells in the midſt of them, and to which they are reſtored after their captivity, when and where will they think it needful to omit it? 4.

                  </q>
                  <p>This fault is further aggreaged from a ſinfull effect following upon it, to wit, their afflicting of their lawfull wives, by taking in other wives in their time, to afflict them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.18. by their ſleighting of them in reſpect of the ſtrange women, and by divorces, (as is after cleared) who being thus oppreſſed did runne to God, and becauſe it was not regarded and amended, therefore God did not regard their ſervice, as if the Altar were covered with the teares and cries of their oppreſſed wives to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their acceptance; otherwiſe it is not properly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they got liberty to come to the Altar, or to poure out their teares upon it. And that it is to be underſtood of this mourning of their wives, hindering their acceptance, is cleare from the following verſe, where the reaſon of Gods rejecting them is held forth. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

It is a mans ſaddeſt diſadvantage, when he gives to any juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to crie to God againſt him, and the beſt remedy to be had of any wrong, is, when we commit it to God by prayer; <hi>This ye have done covering the Altar, with teares, with weeping, and with crying.</hi> This was their afflicted wives refuge, and their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169977:142"/>did it againſt themſelvs, when they gave their wives juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. 3.

                  </q>
                  <p>Becauſe the husbands might be ready to deny ſome of theſe challenges, or to extenuate them, as no relevant ground for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting their ſervice and worſhip. Therefore the Lord layes forth the ſinne of their carriage toward their wives, and aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it as a wrong againſt God, who was preſident and witneſſe in the Covenant of marriage, and to whom the oath was made, and therefore cannot but avenge the wrong, and as being trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous dealing to the wife, who was the mans firſt love from his youth, who hath right to him by Covenant and ſworne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and being by the tie of marriage the companion and halfe of the man, with whom he is one fleſh. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men may be in an evil condition, and yet be little convinced or ſenſible of it, or of the high provocation that is in it; and that it may juſtly make ſervice abominable: <hi>Yet ye ſay, Wherefore?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not our ſervice be accepted? 2. God hath an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intereſt, and is a party in every lawfull paction, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an oath, and eſpecially in the Covenant of marriage, wherein he obſerves wrongs, who are chiefly guilty, and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly puniſh; <hi>The Lord hath been witneſſe between thee and thy wife, againſt whom thou haſt dealt treacherouſly.</hi> 3. Where the Lord hath tied parties in marriage, continuance of conjunction ought to increaſe and ſettle affection, and incident infirmities and blemiſhes ought not to alienate it; for, <hi>She is the wife of thy youth,</hi> married to thee from thy youth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not ſeemly to ſee her deſpiſed now, and was thy choice
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:169977:143"/>in thy youth and hers, and therefore not ſeemly to contemne her, when age and infirmity alters her. 4. As marriage makes man and woman no more two but one fleſh, ſo it is the duty of wives to prove comfortable yoke-fellowes and helpers, not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of their husbands good; and husbands are to intreat them as companions and not ſlaves: <hi>Yet ſhe is thy companion.</hi> 5. Marriage duties are not left arbitrary to parties, whether they will performe them or nor, but by the mutual Covenant, they have given power of their bodies each to other, and are ſtrictly tied to performe the mutual duties required in ſuch a ſtate of life without revocation; <hi>She is the wife of thy Covenant;</hi> and therefore, neither to be rejected, neglected, nor another taken with her.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Lord confirmes the challenge yet further, and ſhewes particularly the ſinne of their carriage: And firſt, concerning polygamie, or taking more wives at once, and bringing in of ſtrange women upon their lawfull wives, he declares it to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inſtitution of marriage, wherein God, who had breath and ſpirit enough to make more women for one man, did only ereate one man and one woman, that ſo there might be a lawfull iſſue procreated in lawfull marriage. Hence he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to keep inviolable the tie of marriage, and for this end to guard their own hearts, and let the ſalvation of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpirits perſwade them to this duty. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In all things wherein a controverſie occurs about what is ſinne or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, right or wrong, we are not to dwell on cuſtome, practice or pretences, but to recur to Gods inſtitution and appointment, to which all reaſonings muſt ſubmit; for, thus is the controverſie of marriage decided. 2. Whatever have been, or may be the cuſtomes of men, yet by Gods inſtitution, both in precept and practice, lawful marriage is only betwixt one man and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and this conjunction, the wiſdom of God (who might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have done otherwiſe,) hath thought moſt convenient for
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169977:143"/>the ends to be attained by marriage-ſociety; to which experience in all ages hath ſubſcribed: <hi>Did he not make one?</hi> and <hi>yet be had the reſidue of the ſpirit.</hi> 3. One and the chief lawful end of marriage is, the hope of poſterity, that man who cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide alwayes on earth, may in a ſort perpetuate himſelf in his poſterity, while the world endureth; one end of marriage is, <hi>to ſeek a ſeed.</hi> 4. Such children as are brought forth in a ſtate of lawful marriage, have an excellencie, which others begotten in uncleanneſſe want; for however grace be free to the one as well as the other; yet it is in it ſelf a dignity and priviledge of men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove beaſts to be thus procreate; <hi>therefore he made one, that he might ſeek a godly ſeed,</hi> or, <hi>ſeed of God,</hi> that is, (as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal imports) <hi>an excellent ſeed,</hi> having that excellencie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully begotten. 5. Reproof would be accepted from God for uſe, and that not only for conviction, but for reformation, <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let none deal treacherouſly, &amp;c.</hi> 6. If mens ſpirits were precious, or their ſalvation dear unto them, it might keep off many ſinful courſes which endanger them; <hi>Take heed to you ſpirits, and let none deal treacherouſly,</hi> may import this, that their precious ſpirits are at the ſtake in this buſineſſe. 7. Men who would keep from ſinful out-breakings, ſhould watch over their own hearts, where the riſe of them is, and ſhould take heed that abilities do not deceive them with excuſing or extenuating their faults; <hi>Take heed to your ſpirits,</hi> may import further, that their luſtful ſpirits are the ſpring of all this miſcarriage, and therefore to be heeded eſpecially, and that mens ſpirits are dangerous patrons of the evils, which their affections are enſlaved to.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, concerning divorces, which was their next ſhift, when they could not get both wives kept, they found meanes to put away their old wives. The Lord declares that to be hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, as not being a quiteing of their violence to their
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:169977:144"/>wives, but an executing of it under that pretext of Law, and ſo but a covering it as with a garment; and again exhorts them to purge and watch over their ſpirits. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever the Lord did permit for the hardneſſe of <hi>Iſraels</hi> heart, yet divorce and looſing of that marriage tie upon trivial cauſes, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe beſide that of adultery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.9. and malicious deſertion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15. is a ſin, and hateful to God; <hi>For the Lord ſaith that he hateth putting away.</hi> 2. Not only doth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God prohibit groundleſſe divorces, but his own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage toward his confederate and married people, in not giving up with them for every fault; ſhewes how unpleaſing ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are to him in others: for, not only <hi>the Lord,</hi> but <hi>the God of Iſrael ſaith</hi> this, his not ceaſing to be the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhewes how unſuitable it is to his mind to break off marriage-affection. 3. The nature of ſinful courſes are not changed, but only daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, when they are acted under pretence of Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſo much the more hateful to God; for, <hi>the Lord hates putting away as covering violence with a garment.</hi> This forme of ſpeech <hi>covering with a garment,</hi> or (as ſome reade it) <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence covering the garment,</hi> ſeemeth to allude to the Scripture-expreſſion, wherein covering with the garment, ſignifieth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal protection, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Ruth</hi> 3.9. and ſo while they ſpread their garment over another wife, they covered that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with a pretext of divorce, and violence covered that act of marrying another: it was but violence, though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have law for the marriage after divorce. 4. The Lords frequent challenges ought to ſtir up men to double diligence in reforming their way, it being a double guiltineſſe to ſin after admonition: and ſuch as would reforme ſin, muſt firſt ſee their ſpirit polluted, and begin their reformation there; for this cauſe is the exhortation repeated; <hi>therefore take heed to your ſpirit, that ye deal not treacherouſly.</hi>

                     <p>Ye have wearied the LORD with your words: yet ye ſay, Wherein have we wearied him? when ye ſay, Every one that doth evil <hi>is</hi> good in the ſight of the LORD, and be delighteth in them, or where <hi>is</hi> the God of judgement?</p>

                  <p>The third fault reproved, is their impatiencie under afflictions, breaking forth into murmuring and blaſphemie againſt God and his Providence, as judging, that becauſe enemies and wicked men proſpered more then they did, either God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of wicked men, and delight in their ſin, or elſe was not a juſt and impartial Judge, or had no Providence at all in the world. This carriage did grieve Gods Spirit, albeit they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denied the fact, or that it was ſuch a ſin to complain. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Hard times drive on tentations unto Atheiſme, and may prevaile with many in the viſible Church, as this example teacheth. 2. Tentations unto Atheiſme begin ordinarily at the matter of Gods Providence in the world; and firſt, it carves out a Providence to mens own minde, that God loves none, but whom he deals kindly with in matters of the world, and that <hi>he delights</hi> in ſuch as he ſpares outwardly. Then it falls a quarrelling under croſſe diſpenſations, that his providence is not juſt, when <hi>every one that is evil is good in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> And at laſt comes to an expreſſe denying of providence, and conſequently of God, <hi>Where is the God of judgement?</hi> 3. Tentations of impatiency and Atheiſme, ariſing from croſſe diſpenſations, do flow from too much conceit of mens ſelves and their deſervings, and prove them not meane in their own eyes, or humbled under the rod; for, while they quarrel his goodneſs to others <hi>that do evil,</hi> it imports they look on themſelves as good, and deſerving no ſuch uſage as they meet with. 4. Impatiencie and quarrelling of Gods Providence is a vexing evil, which the Lord will not endure, eſpecially when men are not wraſtling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it in their boſomes, but let it break out in expreſſion without controulment; <hi>Ye have wearied the Lord with your words, Iſa.</hi> 40.27. He cannot properly wearie, but will do with ſuch, as wearied men do with an inſupportable burden. 5. Men falling in a quarrelling diſpoſition prove themſelves to be deprived of tenderneſſe, and in an ill frame of ſpirit, in that they can neither diſcerne what they are doing, nor be ſenſible of the hainouſneſſe of ſuch an evil, which a tender heart would tremble at; for, theſe murmurers have the boldneſſe and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity to reply to the challenge; <hi>Yet ye ſay, Wherein have we wearied him?</hi>

                  <p>IN the firſt part of this Chapter, we have a Prophecie of Chriſts coming in the fleſh, <hi>v.</hi> 1. who would be found far otherwiſe then many of them looked for, in refining his Church, <hi>v.</hi> 2. purging of his people and Miniſters, that their worſhip may be pure and acceptable, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4. and in manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all wickedneſſe, and taking order with it, <hi>v.</hi> 5. the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which benefits is his unchangeable grace, and the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his promiſe toward his people, <hi>v.</hi> 6. In the ſecond part of the chapter, he accuſeth them of deſperate impenitencie in their defection, <hi>v.</hi> 7. of ſacriledge, <hi>v.</hi> 8. (which as it was a ſpecial cauſe of the judgements lying on them, <hi>v.</hi> 9 ſo upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment, he undertakes remarkably to bleſſe them, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11, 12.) and of blaſphemie and wearying in Gods ſervice, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15. In the third part of the Chapter we have the carriage of the godly in ſuch a time, and the fruit of theſe doctrines upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 16. — who are encouraged from Gods obſervation, and laying up their carriage as upon record, <hi>v.</hi> — 16. from a promiſe of being precious in Gods ſight, and graciouſly and tenderly dealt with, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and that the difference betwixt the godly and wicked in Gods eſteem, ſhall in due time be made manifeſt, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>

                     <p>BEhold, I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me: and the LORD whom ye ſeek, ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple: even the meſſenger of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whom ye delight in: Behold, he ſhall come, ſaith the LORD of hoſtes.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In this Prophecie of Chriſts coming; firſt Chriſt ſpeaks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and promiſeth to ſend <hi>John 'Baptiſt</hi> as his fore-runner and Harbinger, (as is exponed, <hi>Luke</hi> 1, 76, <hi>and</hi> 7.27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.10.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169977:145"/>
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 1.2.) who by the doctrine of repentance and of grace to be given to the penitent through Chriſt, ſhould prepare the way for the exhibition of Chriſt: Then the Father ſpeaks, and promiſes that Chriſt the Meſſenger of the Covenant, whom the Jewes longed ſo much after, ſhould ſhortly after <hi>Johns</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, come into his Temple (being exhibited in the fleſh,) and preach the Goſpel there. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The love of God in Chriſt toward the world, will not be impeded by the wickedneſſe of men, nor will he make void his promiſes of the redemption and ſalvation of his Elect, becauſe of the perverſity of many in the viſible Church; therefore, notwithſtanding their quarrelling, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.17. Chriſt is here promiſed. 2. Convincing evidences of Chriſts Godhead do appear in this Prophecie; as firſt, that he was before his Incarnation, keeping intercourſe with, and making promiſes to his Church; <hi>Behold, I will ſend, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, that he authorizeth and ſendeth meſſengers into his Church in his Name, and upon his errands: <hi>I will ſend my Meſſenger to prepare my way.</hi> Thirdly, that he is Lord of the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he to whom homage was payed there, It is <hi>his Temple.</hi> Fourthly, that when he appears in the forme of a ſervant, a worme and not a man, <hi>Davids</hi> ſon and a ſmall twig out of <hi>Jeſſe</hi>'s root, yet he is under all that vaile, <hi>The LORD,</hi> and above all. Fifthly, that he and his Father are about one and the ſame work, ſpeaking in the ſame promiſe, as being one in eſſence, though diſtinct perſons. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. As Chriſt when he comes to any perſon or people muſt be received as a King, (for Kings have their Harbingers going before them) ſo men are by nature unprepared for the receiving of Chriſt, having ſo many obſtructions laid in his way, being ſo unworthy of ſuch a mercy, and having (in their own conceit) ſo little employment for ſuch a Saviour: and men would ſtill continue ſo, unleſſe Chriſt who freely gives himſelf, do alſo freely prepare his own way, ſo much doth this promiſe: <hi>I will ſend my meſſenger, and he ſhall prepare the way before me,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. 4. It is a ſweet fore-runner of Chriſts coming, when he ſends a Miniſtery amongſt a people, and cauſeth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to take place, eſpecially in convincing of ſin, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of repentance; for thus was <hi>John</hi> in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery a fore-runner of Chriſts Incarnation. 5. Chriſts Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and dwelling in our fleſh, and his preſence hereby in his Church, is the ſweet and refreſhful encouragement of his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:169977:146"/>people, the riches whereof will not be ſeen at firſt view; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the promiſe doubled, and men called to conſider it; <hi>The Lord ſhall come, behold, he ſhall come, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 6. As it is the high priviledge of the Church to be ſingled out among all the world, to enjoy Chriſt and the fruits of his coming: ſo it behoved the true Meſſiah to be incarnate, while the ſecond Temple ſtood, and to come and preach there; for, <hi>the Lord ſhall come to his Temple,</hi> is a Prophecie of his being preſent in the material Temple, as a type of his Church, to which all his ſpecial manifeſtations are. 7. As it is a double mercie when the Lord makes great diſpatch in performing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, conſidering the long attendance others have been put to: ſo where the Miniſtery of the Word, and repentance have place, it is a token the Lord is haſting to manifeſt more of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>The Lord ſhall ſuddenly come,</hi> partly, in reſpect the time betwixt this Prophecie and his exhibition was to be ſhort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how long he had been expected before: and partly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Johns</hi> preaching, and its having place, he ſhould come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden. 8. Albeit Chriſt be God over all, bleſſed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet he took upon him the office of Mediatour and Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of his Father to the Church, and having obtained of his Father, by the Covenant of Redemption, that a Covenant of reconciliation ſhould be betwixt God and man, he came into the world to make offer thereof in preaching the Goſpel, and to confirm it by his own blood: and he it is who from time to time perſwades the Elect to embrace the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and doth make the Covenant ſure to them who flee to him as Mediatour for that end; and confirmes the faith of ſuch as reſt on the Covenant with many proofes of his love: <hi>This Lord</hi> who comes, is <hi>even the meſſenger of the Covenant,</hi> and in all theſe reſpects, he proves himſelf ſo. 9. As Chriſt ought to be, and is unto his peculiar people, their chief deſire and joy, and his preſence, or hope of future manifeſtations of him, their life: ſo many may pretend much reſpect to Chriſt at a diſtance, in hope of ſatisfaction to ſome luſts by him, and may be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in expectation, that if God delay his coming, they will ſcarcely have hope to ſee him at all, and yet miſtake him when he comes: for, Chriſt is <hi>the Lord whom they ſought, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in,</hi> who were not only the godly among them, whoſe hearts longed for his Incarnation, but even the wicked, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to get temporal felicity by him, and who therefore quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:169977:146"/>God for delaying to ſend him. Theſe the Lord promiſes to make liars, but little to their advantage.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Followes a prediction of the effects of Chriſts coming, which was begun when he came in the fleſh to the material Temple, and is verified daily when he comes to his Church in the power of the Goſpel, to reform it, and to governe and rule in it. In general, it is declared that Chriſt will be quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing then hypocrites dream, he will be ſuch a winnower and purger, as it will be hard to abide his trial, which will be as fire to purge droſſe, and as ſope to waſh away filth. Thus was his fan in his hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. and his ſcourge, <hi>John</hi> 2.14, 16, and his axe laid to the root of the tree. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh, and coming even in his low eſtate, is a terrible ſight to his enemies, and will be a ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of offence to many; for, <hi>who may abide the day of his coming? and who may ſtand? &amp;c.</hi> 2. Chriſts coming to his Church in the Miniſtery of his Goſpel, and to carry on a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, makes a time prove very winnowing, and a trying time, and ſo hard to be endured, that it is a wonder to ſee any get through in it: and no wonder if we conſider the many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in his Church, and the great hypocriſie and droſſe of his Saints which he cannot endure; the great viciſſitudes and ſhakings that attend a time of Reformation; the many errours and deluſions that uſually are aloft then; the efficacie of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpel in diſcovering of ſin, by which if men be not amended they grow worſe, the civil turne prophane, the formal looſe, and the prophane inſolent: and how ſpeedily a people under the Goſpel fill up the meaſure of their ſin, and ripen for many judgements; for theſe cauſes it is, that Chriſts coming is held out as ſo terrible a day; <hi>Who may abide? who ſhall ſtand?</hi> 3. Not only is there much unſoundneſſe to be found in Chriſts Church, but this is ill to diſcern till Chriſt diſcover it, and it cleaves cloſe to men, that it is ill to remove for, no leſſe then <hi>a refincers fire, and fullers ſope,</hi> can either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this droſſe in the mettal, and filth in the cloath, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:169977:147"/>it away, his fan only can diſcover the chaffe, and take it away. 4. Chriſt hath power ſufficient to purge his Church, and reach the droſſe, and is ſo zealous that he will not ſpare, and will either conſume altogether, or ſeparate the droſſe away; for, <hi>He is as a refiners fire, and like fullers ſope.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>The particular effects of Chriſts coming and office in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the godly, is the purging of them, his publick worſhip and Miniſters, that ſo their worſhip may be cleanly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, all things being reſtored to their integrity. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The pureſt Church of Chriſt is ſo ready to contract pollution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in time, that purging is needful, and the choice people of God who are not to be deſtroyed, will need purging, as having much droſſe; and it is their comfort that he intends only their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, how hot ſoever the furnace be; for, unto his Church he is <hi>a refiner, and will purifie.</hi> 2. As Chriſts purging of his Church, by his Word, Spirit and rod, ſpeaks his love, and a purpoſe of much good; for, <hi>he ſits</hi> at it as his task that his heart is upon, and <hi>puriſies as gold and ſilver,</hi> precious mettals refined for honourable uſe: ſo muſt the godly ſubmit to his way of purging, either for the time, though <hi>he ſit</hi> at it as a work not to be ſoon done, or for the meaſure of it, though it ſeck them as ſilver and gold is ſought by the fire, as knowing that he ſits at the furnace, and that he will ſtill make it appear his refining is not with ſilver, as to the heat and extremity of the trial, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.10. 3. Chriſts coming under the Goſpel, tends not to the deſtruction of a Miniſtery, though they need indeed to be oft purged; for, <hi>He ſhall purifie the ſons of Levi.</hi> 4. As pure ordinances, and <hi>an offering in righteouſneſſe,</hi> according to the rule, and through the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, is a choice mercy of Chriſts Church: So the mercy is compleated, when
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:169977:147"/>that is joyned with perſonal reformation, when there are <hi>puriſied Levites, and an offering in righteouſneſſe:</hi> and it is perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and reconciliation that ſets men on the way of pure ſervice, and right ſervice muſt begin there; <hi>He ſhall purifie the ſons of Levi, that they may offer an offering in righteouſneſſe.</hi> 5. An holy Miniſtery is an eſpecial bleſſing to the Church, for keeping Ordinances pure, and for being inſtrumental to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e purity among people, and ſetting them on a pure and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable way of worſhip; for, when <hi>the ſons of Levi are purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they offer in righteouſneſſe, and the offerings of Judah and Jeruſalem are pleaſant to the Lord.</hi> 6. As we are not to pleaſe our ſelves with what we do in ſervice, unleſſe God accept of it; ſo the only way of acceptable worſhip is through Chriſt, when he takes any in his hand, and tranſlates them out of their pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted condition, and makes them and their ſervice (which in it ſelf is abominable) well-pleaſing through him; for, when he comes and purifieth his people, <hi>then ſhall the offerings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and Jeruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord.</hi> 7. Chriſt by his coming in the fleſh, and his death and Goſpel is the reſtorer of all things, and the ſubſtance of all excellencies unto them that cloſe with him; for, <hi>to be pleaſant as in the dayes of old, and as in former years,</hi> imports not only that their ſetvice ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, as of old when moſt godly men offered; but that all the remarkable proofs of favour manifeſted toward them, and wondered at in their fathers dayes, as the free reward of their ſervice, are really to be given to the godly in and by Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>The effect of Chriſts coming and office, in reſpect of the wicked, (uttered here again by Chriſt himſelf, that we may remember he is the ſame God with the Father) is, that he will
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169977:148"/>appear and enter in judgement with them; and for that end ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt all wickedneſſe againſt the firſt and ſecond Table, (whereof he names ſome moſt frequent amongſt them) that he may take order with them; and ſo by this threatening he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes their calumnie, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit Chriſts principal end in his Incarnation and coming in the Goſpel, be not to condemn, but to ſave; yet by reaſon of mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it proves a judgement to many in the viſible Church, and not only by the furnace of reformation caſts them out of the Church, but cuts them off by judicial puniſhments mediate or immediate, as an earneſt of their eternal judgement; and this may imbitter ſuch a caſe, that what is ordained to life ſhould be found to death; <hi>I will come near</hi> (whereas ye think I ſtand afar off, yet I will appear, and come ſo near as may reach you) <hi>to judgement.</hi> 2. However men who are deepeſt engaged in ſin, are hardeſt to convince oſt-times; yet as Chriſt ſees all ſin by his vigilant Providence, and by the Minſtery of the Word diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers and layes open ſin in its colours, and by the power thereof, will make corrupt men by their own practice, write their naughtineſſe upon their own forehead: ſo his Word charging home guilt, can make the conſciences of the moſt obſtinate plead againſt themſelves, frame their own proceſſe, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his judgements threatened or inflicted on them; <hi>And I will be a witneſſe,</hi> ſaith he, which imports their blindneſſe, and what the effects of Chriſts coming ſhall be. 3. Sins do ripen quickly under the Goſpel to a meaſure of impie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and ſpeedily fit for judgement; <hi>I will be a ſwift witneſſe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. 4. As the viſible Church is oft-times guilty of monſtrous abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both againſt the firſt and ſecond Table, (none being more corrupt then they who ought to be beſt, and will not) which call aloud for vengeance; ſo the root of all theſe is, the want of the feare of God; for, here are <hi>ſorcerers, adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> and all ſummed up in this, <hi>and fear not me, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi>

                  <p>The reaſon of the preceding Prophecie is fetched from Gods unchangeableneſſe, and his immutable grace and conſtancie in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:169977:148"/>his promiſe, which preſerves <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and brings about theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of ſending Chriſt unto them, and his purging and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ordinances; and is the cauſe of conſtant kindneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Elect, who otherwiſe do ſo often provoke him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; and it meets alſo with their quarrelling him, that he would not prove a God of judgement; for that would have conſumed them, (conſidering their temper, as is hinted, <hi>v.</hi> 5.) which out of his unchangeable purpoſe of love to them as his people he had hitherto forborne. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men may be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling a diſpenſation, which yet it is their great mercy to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; and may quarrel Gods not appearing in a ſad time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he did appear, it would conſume themſelves: thus did they quarrel and complain without cauſe, as is before explained. 2. God is immutable in his nature, eſſence, properties and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as having being from himſelf, and being independent on all other who might overſway him, and infinite in wiſdom that needs no after-thoughts; and albeit he may change his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, yet his purpoſes ſtand firme, and are carried on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably by various and contrary meanes; <hi>I am Jehovah, I change not.</hi> 3. There is no Church or people of God, but in themſelves they are worthy to be conſumed, conſidering their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſinfulneſſe, their daily provocations and inconſtancie in any good, and the worthleſneſſe of their beſt things: and any forbearance they enjoy is from a cauſe without them: for, <hi>if the ſonnes of Jacob are not conſumed,</hi> it is not of themſelves, but of God. 4. Such as God hath choſen to himſelf of his free grace to be his people, may in the midſt of their inconſtancy and failings, (when they are ſenſible of them, and driven to Chriſt by them) comfort themſelves in the immutability of Gods love, which alters not as their condition alters: and whatever the Lords dealing to them be, they may reckon that it flowes from no change of purpoſe in him, who is ſtill the ſame, and that he intends not to deſtroy or reject them; ſo did the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having a peculiar promiſe finde, and ſo will all the Elect finde; <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, therefore ye ſonnes of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi>

                  <p>In the ſecond part of the chapter, the Lord challenges them, and conteſts with them for ſeveral faults, which may prove that it came of him that they were not conſumed. The firſt ſault challenged is their defection, and their rebellion and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in it. However that Nation had continued in a long trade of ſin, the poſterity ſubſcribing to their fathers ſins, by following their footſteps; yet the Lord offered upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to be reconciled unto them, and to grant them the wonted ſignes of his favour, taking away the tokens of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but they would not be convinced of any need of repentance, and ſo denied the accuſation, and rejected the exhortation and encouragement. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. New defections do juſtly bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer iniquities, and a trade of ſin to remembrance, that men may ſee the ſad fruit of giving once way to ſin, and what a judgement is on them who think little of all theſe ſins, and that they may be an aggravation of preſent ſins, as filling up the meaſure of former iniquities: <hi>Even from the dayes of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ye are gone away from my Ordinances.</hi> 2. As Apoſtaſie from former profeſſions and engagements by new ſin, doth adde much to the ſin; ſo Apoſtaſie from the wayes of God will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty follow on, not ſerious walking in them, as being near a kin to it; <hi>Ye have gone away</hi> by apoſtaſie, <hi>from mine Ordinances; and have not kept them.</hi> 3. It ſets out the great mercy of God, that after much apoſtaſie, he offers reconciliation upon repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and this offer doth highly aggravate impenitency: <hi>Return to me, and I will returue to you, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 4. It is an ordinary plague and judgement upon them who are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt engaged in ſin, that the cuſtome of ſin makes them that they conſider not that they do evil, that they ſee leaſt need of repentance, and are moſt hardly convinced; <hi>But ye ſaid, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhall we return?</hi>

                  <p>The ſecond fault challenged, (which proves the general chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and anſwers their reply, <hi>v.</hi> 7.) is their ſacriledge in withholding tithes from the Prieſts, and offerings from the Temple, whereof the Prieſts had a ſhare for their maintenance. This the Lord accounts robbing of him, which no Pagan would do to his idol. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the Will of God, that his publick worſhip be upheld, and that theſe who are ſet apart for the publick worſhip of God, be maintained thereby: and who ſo do withhold that are guilty of groſſeſt defection, as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the whole publick worſhip and Ordinances of God at one ſtroak; for, he proves that challenge, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>of going away from his Ordinances,</hi> by withholding <hi>tithes and offerings.</hi> 2. To withhold maintenance from the Miniſters of the Word, is a robbing of God; for, not only where that is withheld, his ſervice is ſleighted alſo, <hi>tithes and offerings</hi> go together; but it is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting of God, who hath commanded the contrary, a depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him of that which is conſecrated to him, and dedicated to his publick worſhip, and an affronting of his ſervice, as if it were not worth any expence, and ſo making men to faint in it; <hi>Ye have robbed me in tithes and offerings.</hi> 3. Men may be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great injuries to God, when yet they will not ſee it, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how much God is reflected on by their way, or how deep their iniquity draweth; for, ſo doth their exception to the challenge import; <hi>Yet ye ſay, Wherein have we robbed thee?</hi> 4. The reſpect that Pagans have to their idols, and their care to uphold ſervice unto them, will condemn many who profeſſe to ſerve the true and living God, and yet neither have reſpect nor love to him, nor have any care to maintain and uphold his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: <hi>Will a man rob God?</hi> any thing he counts a god; <hi>and yet ye have robbed me.</hi>

                  <p>He declares that becauſe of this ſin, God had curſed them with a general want, and exhorts them to amend this fault, promiſing to give a proof that his accuſation hath been juſt and that their repentance and amending their fault ſhould be acceptable, by giving them raine and the influences of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to cauſe the earth to bring forth in abundance: and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving impediments of a fruitful harveſt, by keeping off de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying creatures, and preventing their trees from untimely caſting their fruit. So that Gods bleſſing ſhould be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous upon them, as ſhould take away their reproach of being a Nation plagued of God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. People never thrive the better, that they neglect Gods ſervice, and think to increaſe their ſtock by withholding what is due from Gods ſervants, but are ordinarily ſerved in their own coyne, and plagued with as much want as they drive his ſervants to; and however, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly purſued with a curſe in all that they have, which can ſoon overſpread a whole Kingdome; <hi>Ye are curſed with a curſe, for ye have robbed me, even this whole Nation.</hi> 2. It is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe who would uphold Gods ſervice, not only to give what is requiſite for maintenance of the Miniſters thereof, but to do it voluntarily, and ſo as Miniſters may be free of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions from their great work; <hi>Bring,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the tithes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtore-houſe.</hi> 3. If men would repent and amend their ſinful courſes, they might meet with ſuch proofes of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as would convince them that they had forſaken their own mercy formerly, though they would not ſee it; and that much of God is to be found of theſe who wait on him in his own way for it: for, the Lord ſubmits to a trial from experience, if theſe quarrellers would leave their debates, and put him to it; <hi>Let there be meat in my houſe, and prove me now herewith, if I will not open upon you the windowes of heaven, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Many ſteps
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:169977:150"/>of divine Providence and care, may be read in our very daily bread and plentiful proviſion; <hi>The opening of the windowes of heaven, and pouring out of a bleſſing, the rebuking of the devourer from deſtroying fruits,</hi> when the influences of heaven have produced them, <hi>and keeping of trees from caſting fruit before the time,</hi> ſhewes how many wayes an angry God can reach ſinners in theſe things, how richly he can provide for his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and how ſufficiently ſecure it to them. 5. As Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon his reconciled people, will be conſpicuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; ſo the very reproach of being under Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ought to affect the ſinner, and be a motive to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reformation, that God may roll away that reproach as he is ready to do; for, it is an argument to invite them who are under a curſe, to turn from their evil wayes: <hi>All Nations ſhall call you bleſſed, for ye ſhall be a delightſome land.</hi>

                  <p>The third fault reproved, (wherein they ſhewed much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption) is their murmuring and wicked blaſphemie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it a vaine thing to ſerve God, becauſe they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to obey God, and walk humbly under ſin or judgements in ſome ceremonial performances, were not anſwered according to their luſts; and bleſſing the groſſely wicked, becauſe when they went the very length of tempting God in their wickedneſs, yet they eſcaped trouble and were exalted. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a preſumptuous and bold courſe, when men dare not only ſecretly murmur againſt God, his Providence and their duty, but dare openly publiſh and avowſuch miſtakes, and reject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:169977:151"/>for it as a ſin; <hi>Your words have been ſtout: yet ye ſay, What have we ſpoken ſo much againſt thee?</hi> 2. As it is deſperate preſumption for men to caſt out with pietie: ſo the Lord will have every one that ſerves him tried in their ſincerity, and whether or not any thing will drive them on ſuch a ſnare; for here, theſe who pretended to much ſervice, ſpake ſtoutly and <hi>ſaid, It is vaine to ſerve God.</hi> 3. It is a character of true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, when men do indeed cleave cloſe to the revealed Will of God, and yet are humble for all they do, when they are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their ſhort-comings, and do ſtoop and mourne under any corrections, conſidering the greatneſſe and power of God with whom they have to do; for, this is true pietie which they pretend to, <hi>to keep his ordinance, and walk mournfully before the Lord of hoſtes.</hi> 4. It is a great evidence of unfoundneſſe when men deſpiſe pietie and the way of God, becauſe of the want of outward ſucceſſe, as if pietie and a good conſcience were not a reward to it ſelf, and as if it were not fit that God purged his own people, that they might bring forth more fruit: They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it <hi>vaine to ſerve God,</hi> for, <hi>what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance? &amp;c.</hi> 5. It is alſo a great evidence of unfoundneſſe, when men ſee too well their own performances, and are proud of them: and this conceit is the cauſe of mens quarrelling when their lots pleaſe them not; for, theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers ſee their own worth, and what they did, and becauſe of this complaine, whereas mens humility loſeth the luſtre where they ſee it, and ſwell with it. 6. It may pleaſe the Lord for a ſnare to ſinners, and a trial to others, and that none may doat on outward things, not only to deliver ſinners out of troubles, but when they come to the height of impiety, as not to own God, or tempt and put him to it, to make that a meanes of advancement; for, <hi>They that work wickedneſſe are ſet up, and they that tempt God are even delivered.</hi> 7. The proſperity of wicked men in wicked courſes is a trial of ſincerity, and will readily draw unfound hypocrites not only to be diſcouraged in what of Religion they pretend to, but openly to ſide with impiety as the only bleſſed way; <hi>We call the proud hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, &amp;c.</hi>

Communion of Saints in mutual conference and admonition, being held within the bounds of mens ſtation, and tending to ſtrengthen againſt the tentations of the time, and not made an engine to enſnare and draw men to them, is a neceſſary duty, and an eſpecial meanes of life in a declining time; <hi>They that feared the Lord, ſpake often one to another.</hi> 3.

The Lord confirms yet further, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be betwixt the godly and the wicked, by ſhewing the judgements to come on the wicked, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and mercies to the godly, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and their victory over their enemies, <hi>v.</hi> 3.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:169977:153"/>2. The Prophecie is cloſed with an admonition to adhere to the written Word, prophecie being now to ceaſe, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and to expect for, and mark the coming of the Meſſiah, which ſhould be knowen by the coming of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>v.</hi> 5. the end and efficacy of whoſe doctrine is held forth, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>

                     <p>For behold, the day cometh that ſhall burne as an Oven, and the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burne them up, ſaith the LORD of hoſtes, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The particle <hi>for</hi> ſhewes that the Lord is confirming that aſſertion, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.18. of a viſible difference to be betwixt the godly and the wicked. And firſt, for the wicked he threatens that they ſhall be as eaſily and totally conſumed, as a fiery Oven burnes ſtubble. This was accompliſhed upon the body of the Jewiſh Nation, ſhortly after the firſt coming of Chriſt, when they were utterly ſcattered, their land waſted, and city burnt; and is alſo of verity in the particular judgement of every wicked man; and in the ſecond coming of Chriſt, when the whole Word hath its full and final accompliſhment. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Man by nature is a proud creature, and retaines a ſtamp of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the devils ſin, that would be as God; Humility is no native plant in fallen man: they are <hi>the proud</hi> whom God hath to do with. 2. A mans daring to hazard on wicked wayes, which the moſt high God hath prohibited, and guarded with ſad threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is a clear evidence of pride, let him otherwiſe appear ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo humble; <hi>the proud, and all that do wickedly,</hi> are conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being the ſame, and the latter an evidence of the former, as <hi>chap.</hi> 3.15. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.21. 3. The ſtouteſt of creatures will prove but weak, when God reveals his juſtice, and deals with them in wrath; <hi>The proud, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be ſtubble</hi> to the fire, <hi>in the day of the Lord that cometh.</hi> 4. The pure wrath of the living God is a dreadful thing, leaving nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope of out-gate, nor preſent mitigation, but violently conſumes all without recovery; <hi>The day ſhall burne us an Oven,</hi> (where the heat is cloſed in, and all that is put in it ſhut up
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:169977:153"/>from coming out,) <hi>and ſhall burn them up, and leave them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root nor branch.</hi>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>But unto you that feare my Name, ſhall the Sun of righteouſneſſe ariſe with healing in his wings, and ye ſhall go forth and grow up as Calves of the ſtall.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>As for the godly, he promiſes to ſend Chriſt unto them, bringing illumination, righteouſneſſe, healing, protection, and encreaſe of grace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. An infallible character of the truly godly, is their reverence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare, (preſumption being very contrary unto piety,) and that not only of Gods juſtice and terrible judgements, which the wicked may tremble at, but alſo of his Name, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he reveals himſelf by, his Word being enough to make them tremble, <hi>Iſa</hi> 66.2. and his goodneſſe to make them feare, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>ye that feare my Name,</hi> get the promiſe, 2. Chriſt is the ſubſtance of the godlies encouragement, as being unto his Church and children in a ſuper-excellent manner, what the Sun is to this inferiour world, in enlightening all their darkneſſe, illuminating all the inferiour lights that ſhine in any meaſure, making all hid things patent, rejoycing, warming, cheriſhing, and ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all fruits; <hi>Unto you that feare my Name, ſhall the Sun ariſe.</hi> 3. Not only is every man by nature and without Chriſt, in a dark, diſconſolate condition till he come unto them; but his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of himſelf under the Law, was far inferiour to that under the Goſpel, which is far more clear, glorious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, then the legal ſhadowes were: for, where Chriſt comes, <hi>the Sunariſeth</hi> after a dark night; and this eſpecially relates to his Incarnation, which is Sun-light in compariſon of the Old Teſtament, which had but, as it were, Moon-light. 4. That which makes Chriſt eſpecially comfortable to the godly is, that he brings glorious righteouſneſſe to them, whereby they who durſt not appear before God, and are vile and menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; become glorious and beautiful in the eyes of the Lord; he is not only <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> but <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſſe,</hi> glorious righteouſneſſe unto them. 5. As theſe who get good of Chriſt, will have many ſores, and be made to feel the deadly wounds and diſeaſes which every one by nature hath: ſo Chriſt is the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:169977:154"/>only Phyſician to cure ſuch ſores, and deliver his people from all ſickneſſe of ſin and miſery: <hi>He ariſes with healing.</hi> 6. Chriſts merit, and his love and providence is the ſweet ſhelter of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when purſued by their enemies; and theſe who would taſte of his healing vertue, are to lie near this Sun, and get in under his beams and rayes, which embrace and cheriſh the ſick till they be healed; He hath warme <hi>wings</hi> to hide us under, and this <hi>healing is under his wings.</hi> 7. As every man by nature is but a priſoner, and a ſlave to Satan and his own luſts: and lying under the power of a hard heart and ſpirit of bondage, and their ſouls are alſo waſted with leanneſſe, and feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the husks: ſo Chriſt being fled unto, and enjoyed, and made uſe of, as the ſoules ſhepherd, brings ſpiritual libertie, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace to make fat and flouriſhing, and of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Lord; <hi>Ye ſhall go forth and grow up as Calves of the ſtall;</hi> who being well fed and ſet at liberty, do skip for joy.</p>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>And ye ſhall tread down the wicked: for they ſhall be aſhes under the ſoles of your feete, in the day that I ſhall do <hi>this,</hi> ſaith the LORD of hoſtes.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>To make this difference yet more conſpicuous, he not only threatens judgements againſt the wicked, and promiſes ſpiritual comforts to the godly, but promiſes to bring the wicked under the godlies feet, and to make them triumph ſolidly over all their enemies. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever external excellencie be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the wicked, yet they are, in compariſon of the godly, but vile and contemptible, and will in due time appear ſo; they are but <hi>aſhes</hi> to be tread upon by the godly. 2. Albeit the godly are oft-times lying under the feet of wicked enemies, yet not only are they even then Conquerours over all their enemies in Chriſt their Head, and by faith which keeps them from hurt, and brings them advantage from their troubles, and makes them boaſt in God over all of them, and ſometime get their hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enemies even in this world, either by themſelves or by others: But in due time their victory ſhall be compleat and viſible, when they ſhall be ſet with Chriſt on his throne, and all the wicked made his and their footſtool; <hi>Ye ſhall tread down the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:169977:154"/>wicked, for they ſhall be aſhes under the ſoles of your feet, in the day that I ſhall do this, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes.</hi>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>Remember the Law of Moſes my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Iſrael, with the ſtatutes and judgements.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This Prophecie, (as alſo the reſt, he being the laſt) is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſome directions to the Church, whereof the firſt is, that ſince there was no other extraordinary Prophet to ſucceed him, till Chriſt and his fore-runner ſhould come, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terrible ſchiſmes and commotions to enſue amongſt them, therefore they would have recourſe to the written Word, therein to ſeek eternal life, and inſtruction how to walk in Gods way, till they come to the actual poſſeſſion of ſalvation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The written Word of God is to be cloſely adhered unto, as that which will direct our courſe in dark times, which ought to be the rule of our faith, worſhip and manners, which will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of extraordinary revelations, and to which all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelations agree, and bear witneſſe, and will afford matter of comfort in ſaddeſt times, and for attaining theſe ends, the Church is to be much in the ſtudie thereof; upon theſe grounds is this charge given, <hi>Remember ye the Law of Moſes.</hi> 2. The doctrine revealed by God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him to the Church, containes the ſubſtance of all that is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and is the foundation of all the reſt of the Scriptures, which are as a Commentary and particular application of it: upon this ground it is that they are remitted to <hi>the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> not to ſeek juſtification by the works of the Law, nor yet only to be led by the Law to Chriſt, but as containing the ſumme of all the doctrine of the Prophets, which they would not neglect who made conſcience of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, as being Gods own Commentarie upon it, enjoyned as an appendicle to it. 3. That the Word may have place, and be entertained with due reverence and reſpect, we are ſeriouſly to conſider the authority of God enjoyning it, <hi>I commanded:</hi> our obligation to it, and our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in enjoying it, <hi>I commanded for all Iſrael,</hi> and only <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſecluding other Nations: the Majeſtie of God at any time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in or about that Word, how dreadful he was in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at firſt, what of God hath appeared in refreſhments by, or
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169977:155"/>judgements and mercies according to that Word, <hi>I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it him in Horeb</hi> with great glory: and what authority his ſervants have to inculcate that Word upon us, and how much their fidelity in duty will condemn our contempt, <hi>Remember the Law of Moſes my ſervant which I commanded him.</hi> 4. Such as make conſcience of ſubmitting to, and walking by the rule of Gods Word, will be far from allowing to themſelves or others, a liberty in ſome points of truth and practice, to believe or do as they pleaſe, providing they keep right in ſome chief and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental things, but will be tender of the whole Will of God, of leſſer and greater Commandments, they are enjoyned to <hi>remember</hi> the ceremonial <hi>ſtatutes</hi> and political <hi>judgements,</hi> as well as the moral <hi>Law,</hi> and in a word, his whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

                     </bibl>
                     <p>Behold, I will ſend you Elijah the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>A ſecond direction is, earneſtly to expect Chriſts coming, and to prevent any miſtake about it, he premoniſhes them, that he would ſend <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt in the ſpirit and power of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> immediately before his coming. This is ſo clearly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the New Teſtament, <hi>Luks</hi> 1.17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.14. and 17.11, 12. that it is high preſumption to contradict it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Chriſts coming in the fleſh, and as a Prophet to his Church, is not only greatly to be reverenced by the godly, (as when <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> had the viſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.17.) but indeed terrible unto the wicked, and may be the occaſion of terrible judgements to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt viſible Churches, whoſe meaſure of ſin will be filled up by contempt of ſuch an offer: It is <hi>the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</hi> And ſo the Nation of the Jewes found it. 2. Chriſt is not eaſily diſcerned when he comes to his Church, as not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in ſuch a way as carnal men imagine, but may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and rejected, or another taken for him, which becauſe it is the hinge whereupon our happineſſe turnes, that we have Chriſt indeed, and miſtake him not in his manifeſtations, nor embrace a deluſion in his ſtead, therefore we would ſtudie ſure and cleare light in this truth: Hence it is that the Lord ſo much guards this, by ſhewing the marks of the Meſſiahs coming, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169977:155"/>
                     <hi>Mark</hi> begins where <hi>Malachi</hi> leaves off, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.3. Miniſters who would preach repentance unto a people, and fit them for the Kingdom of Chriſt, ought to be men of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijahs</hi> temper, for through zeal and integrity, for courage and fidelity, to reſiſt a declining generation, to contend with the greateſt decliners, and freely to reprove the ſins of the time; ſuch a one was Chriſts fore-runner, he was <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, as coming in his Spirit and power, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.</p>

                     <p>And he ſhall turne the heart of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, leſt I come and ſmite the earth with a curſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Johns</hi> doctrine is commended from the end of it, which is to convert the people to prevent the curſe; and from the efficacie of it, that by his preaching for reformation of the Church, he ſhall either be inſtrumental to convert both elder and younger, and make an harmonie in faith amongſt themſelves, and with the Patriarchs their Anceſtors, from whom they had ſo far dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, as that they might juſtly renounce them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. and to beget mutual love amongſt them, as a ſure fruit of faith; or elſe they, being unfit to receive and embrace Chriſt, the whole Nation ſhould be ripened for the enſuing curſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that his Miniſtery ſhould be bleſſed to convert ſome of all ranks, and bring them to unity in the truth and love, that the Nation be not totally rejected and deſtroyed, but a remnant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lord in mercy ſends his Miniſtery with the doctrine of repentance, to prevent ſadder meſſengers and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages: ſo a Miniſtery will either be effectual to convert, or ripen for ruine: It is the Lords laſt Word to his Church, that the lively Miniſtery of the Word, will either ruine the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of men, or occaſion mens own ruine, on whom it hath no ſaving effect, as here we may ſee. 2. True Converſion, and the fruit of the Miniſtery of the Word, will ſhew it ſelf in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all ranks, (both the old that have lived long in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themſelves, and the young who may ſeem not to have gone far aſtray,) ſee need of repentance and reformation, and making uſe of Chriſt, in diſcovering unto men how far they have degenerated from the rule, and from the piety of Anceſtors,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:169977:156"/>of whom they are ready to glory in a carnal way; and will u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite men in adhering to the truth of Religion, and in the bond of love: <hi>He ſhall turne the heart of the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the heart of the children to their fathers,</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port all theſe. 3. The great love of Chriſt toward the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that no provocation would hinder him to come and perfect the work of Redemption, however his coming was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ruine to many; <hi>I come,</hi> is an abſolute promiſe made by Chriſt as God. 4. Such as embrace not the Word of God to fit them for Chriſt, nor will admit of the grace offered by Chriſt and his ſervants, are lying under the curſe, from which Chriſt alone can free men: and do provoke him to let that curſe break forth, to the utter ruine of Nations and viſible Churches; for, ſuch is the certification, if <hi>Johns</hi> Miniſtery had no place, and conſequently Chriſts, whoſe way he prepared, <hi>Leſt I come and ſmite the earth with a curſe.</hi> 5. As the Lord is alwayes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in ſome meaſure, by them whom he calls and ſends forth about his work: ſo faithful Miniſters, (however looked on as turners of the world up-ſide down) are as pillars to uphold a Nation, and according to the meaſure of their being fruitful among a people, ſhall the moderation of a judgement on a people be; for, <hi>John ſhall turne</hi> ſome, his zealous Miniſtery was a means, if it had been received, to prevent that curſe on <hi>Judea,</hi> which after followed: and his turning of ſome, as alſo Chriſts ſucceſſe, (whoſe way he prepared) and the Apoſtles, was a means of preſerving a remnant of that Nation from the curſe, as a ſeed and firſt fruit, till the encreaſe and lump of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſaved and turned to the Lord; <hi>Even ſo come, LORD JESUS. Amen.</hi>
